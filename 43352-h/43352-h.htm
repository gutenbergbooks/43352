<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>It is now more than twenty years since a reviewer of the author’s
<cite>Englische Metrik</cite>, in three volumes, expressed the opinion that ‘an
English translation of it would do a service to English philology’.
At that time, however, it seemed doubtful whether such a voluminous
work, which probably would have interested only a comparatively small
circle of English scholars, would have found a market. Even in Germany,
although the work was favourably reviewed, and although at the time
when it appeared great interest was felt in metrical research, the sale
was comparatively slow.</p>

<p>Much livelier, on the other hand, was the demand for an abridged edition
of it which appeared under the title <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Grundriss der englischen Metrik</cite>
(Wien, 1895). It was therefore found possible, several years after its
publication, to make arrangements with the Delegates of the Clarendon
Press for an English edition of this smaller book. Unfortunately,
however, the printing of the manuscript, which was submitted to the
supervision of the late Professor York Powell, was delayed, first by the
illness and the untimely death of that eminent scholar, and afterwards
by other circumstances which it is not necessary to mention here.</p>

<p>On the whole the English text of the present volume is a close rendering
of the German book, except in the first few chapters, which have been
somewhat more fully<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_iv" id="Pg_iv" title="iv"></a> worked out. It may also be mentioned that one or
two modern English poets who seemed to be unduly neglected in the German
book have received a larger share of attention in the English edition.
Some errors of the original work have, of course, also been corrected
here.</p>

<p>The treatment of the subject in this handbook is the same as in the
author’s larger work. The systematic arrangement of the different kinds
of verse in Book I, and of the varieties of stanzas in Book II, will
enable the reader easily to find the appropriate place for any new forms
of verse or stanza that may come in his way, and will also facilitate
the use of the large German work, to which frequent references are
given, for the benefit of those students who may desire more detailed
information.</p>

<p>From the Preface to the German edition of the present work some remarks
on the accents, chiefly in Part II of Book I, may be repeated here in
order to prevent misunderstanding.</p>

<p>These accents on particular syllables in equal-measured rhythms are
merely meant to facilitate the scansion of the verse according to the
author’s view of its rhythmical movement, and to enable the student to
apprehend more readily the precise meaning of the descriptions. They are
by no means intended to dictate a schematic scansion to the reader, as
it is obvious that the finer shades of the rhythm cannot be indicated
by such a mode of accentuation. The safer and easier way undoubtedly
would have been to put no accents at all; but this would have been
less convenient for the reader, to whose own judgement it may be left
in every case to be guided by the accents just so far as he may think
proper.</p>

<p>In making this statement, however, I may be allowed to mention that none
of the English friends who kindly<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_v" id="Pg_v" title="v"></a> assisted me in revising my manuscript
has found fault with my system of accentuation.</p>

<p>My sincerest thanks for their kind help and advice are due to Dr.
Francis J. Curtis, now Professor of English Philology in the Mercantile
Academy at Frankfort on the Main, and in a still higher degree to Dr.
James Morison, of Shotover Cottage, Headington Quarry, Oxford, Examiner
in Sanskrit and German, both of them formerly Lectors of English in
the University of Vienna. I am under equally great obligations to Dr.
Henry Bradley, to whose care the final revision of the MS. was entrusted
by the Delegates of the Clarendon Press, and who also had the great
kindness to superintend the printing of it. To him I am indebted for
several useful suggestions regarding the typographical arrangement, and
still more for his valuable help in regard to the style of the book. To
the Delegates and the Secretary of the Clarendon Press I feel greatly
obliged not only for undertaking the publication, but also for the
patient consideration they have shown me during the slow progress of
this work.</p>

<h2>BOOK I. THE LINE</h2>

<h2>PART I. THE NATIVE METRE</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br />
  <span class="subtitle">GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE SCIENCE OF<br />
  METRE AND THE STRUCTURE OF VERSE</span></h3>

<p><a name="section1" id="section1"></a>
§ <b>1.</b> The study of English Metre is an integral part of English
Philology. It is indispensable to the investigator of the history of
the language, since it supplies sometimes the only (or at all events
the surest) means of restoring the older pronunciation of word-stems,
and of inflexional terminations. In many cases, indeed, the very
existence of such terminations can be proved only by the ascertained
requirements of metre. As an aid to the study of English literature
in its aesthetic aspects the science of metre is no less important.
It exhibits the gradual development of the artistic forms of poetical
composition, explains the conditions under which they took their rise,
and by formulating the laws of their structure affords valuable help in
the textual criticism of poems which have been transmitted in a corrupt
or imperfect condition.</p>

<p><a name="section2" id="section2"></a>
§ <b>2.</b> The object of the science of metre is to describe and analyse the
various rhythmical forms of speech that are characteristic of poetry in
contradistinction to prose.</p>

<p>Poetry is one of the fine arts, and the fine arts admit of a division
into Plastic and Rhythmic; the Plastic arts comprehending Sculpture,
Architecture, and Painting, the Rhythmic arts, on the other hand,
comprehending Dancing, Music, and Poetry. The chief points of difference
between these classes are as follows. In the first place, the
productions of the Plastic arts can be enjoyed by the beholder directly
on their completion by the artist without the interposition of any help,
while those of the Rhythmic arts demand, after the original creative
artist has done his work, the services of a second or executive artist,
who is usually termed the performer, in order that these productions may
be fully enjoyed by the spectator or hearer. A piece of<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_2" id="Pg_2" title="2"></a> music requires
a singer or player, a pantomime a dancer, and poetry a reciter or actor.
In early times the function of executive artist was commonly discharged
by the creative artist himself. In the second place, the Plastic arts
have no concern with the relations of time; a work of painting or
sculpture presents to the beholder an unchanging object or represents a
single moment of action. The Rhythmic arts, on the other hand, are, in
their very essence, connected with temporal succession. Dancing implies
a succession of movements of the human body, Music a succession of
inarticulate sounds, Poetry a succession of articulate sounds or words
and syllables. The Plastic arts, therefore, may be called the arts of
space and rest, and the Rhythmic arts the arts of time and movement. In
this definition, it must be remembered, the intrinsic quality of the
movements in each of these rhythmical arts is left out of account; in
the case of poetry, for instance, it does not take into consideration
the choice and position of the words, nor the thought expressed by them;
it is restricted to the external characteristic which these arts have in
common.</p>

<p><a name="section3" id="section3"></a>
§ <b>3.</b> This common characteristic, however, requires to be defined
somewhat more precisely. It is not merely succession of movements, but
succession of different kinds of movement in a definite and recurring
order. In the dance, the measure, or succession and alternation of quick
and slow movements in regular and fixed order, is the essential point.
This is also the foundation of music and poetry. But another elementary
principle enters into these two arts. They are not founded, as dancing
is, upon mere silent movements, but on movements of audible sounds,
whether inarticulate, as in music, or articulate, as in poetry. These
sounds are not all on a level in respect of their audibility, but vary
in intensity: broadly speaking, they may be said to be either loud or
soft. There is, it is true, something analogous to this in the movements
of the dance; the steps differ in degree of intensity or force. Dancing
indeed may be looked upon as the typical form and source of all rhythmic
movement. Scherer brings this point out very well.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He says: ‘Rhythm
is produced by regular movements of the body. Walking becomes dancing by
a definite relation of the steps to one another&mdash;of long and short in
time or fast and slow in motion. A regular rhythm has never been reached
by races among which irregular jumping, instead of walking,<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_3" id="Pg_3" title="3"></a> has been
the original form of the dance. Each pair of steps forms a unity, and a
repetition begins with the third step. This unity is the bar or measure.
The physical difference between the comparative strength of the right
foot and the weakness of the left foot is the origin of the distinction
between elevation and depression, i.e. between relatively loud and
soft, the “good” and the “bad” part of the measure.’</p>

<p>Westphal<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> gives a similar explanation: ‘That the stamp of the foot or
the clap of the hands in beating time coincides with the strong part
of the measure, and the raising of the foot or hand coincides with the
weak part of it, originates, without doubt, in the ancient orchestic.’
At the strong part of the bar the dancer puts his foot to the ground and
raises it at the weak part. This is the meaning and original Greek usage
of the terms ‘arsis’ and ‘thesis’, which are nowadays used in an exactly
opposite sense. <em>Arsis</em> in its ancient signification meant the raising
of the foot or hand, to indicate the weak part of the measure; <em>thesis</em>
was the putting down of the foot, or the stamp, to mark the strong part
of the measure. Now, however, it is almost the universal custom to use
<em>arsis</em> to indicate the syllable uttered with a raised or loud voice,
and <em>thesis</em> to indicate the syllable uttered with lower or soft voice.
From the practice of beating time the term <em>ictus</em> is also borrowed; it
is commonly used to designate the increase of voice which occurs at the
strong, or so-called rhythmical accent.</p>

<p>All rhythm therefore in our dancing, poetry, and music, comes to us from
ancient times, and is of the same nature in these three arts: it is
regular order in the succession of different kinds of motion.</p>

<p><a name="section4" id="section4"></a>
§ <b>4.</b> The distinction between prose and poetry in their external
aspects may be stated thus: in prose the words follow each other in an
order determined entirely, or almost entirely, by the sense, while in
poetry the order is largely determined by fixed and regular rhythmic
schemes.</p>

<p>Even in prose a certain influence of rhythmical order may be sometimes
observable, and where this is marked we have what is called rhythmical
or artistic prose. But in such prose the rhythmic order must be so
loosely constructed that it does not at once obtrude itself on the ear,
or recur regularly as it does in poetry. Wherever we have intelligible
words following each other in groups marked by a rhythmical order
which is at once recognizable as intentionally chosen with a view to
symmetry,<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_4" id="Pg_4" title="4"></a> there we may be said to have poetry, at least on its formal
side. Poetical rhythm may accordingly be defined as a special symmetry,
easily recognizable as such, in the succession of syllables of differing
phonetic quality, which convey a sense, and are so arranged as to be
uttered in divisions of time which are symmetrical in their relation to
one another.</p>

<p><a name="section5" id="section5"></a>
§ <b>5.</b> At this point we have to note that there are two kinds of
phonetic difference between syllables, either of which may serve as a
foundation for rhythm. In the first place, syllables differ in respect
of their <em>quantity</em>; they are either ‘long’ or ‘short’, according to the
length of time required to pronounce them. In the second place, they
differ in respect of the greater or less degree of force or stress with
which they are uttered; or, as it is commonly expressed, in respect of
their <em>accent</em>.</p>

<p>All the poetic rhythms of the Indogermanic or Aryan languages are
based on one or other of these phonetic qualities of syllables, one
group observing mainly the quantitative, and the other the accentual
principle. Sanskrit, Greek, and Roman poetry is regulated by the
principle of the quantity of the syllable, while the Teutonic nations
follow the principle of stress or accent.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> With the Greeks, Romans,
and Hindoos the natural quantity of the syllables is made the basis of
the rhythmic measures, the rhythmical ictus being fixed without regard
to the word-accent. Among the Teutonic nations, on the other hand, the
rhythmical ictus coincides normally with the word-accent, and the order
in which long and short syllables succeed each other is (with certain
exceptions in the early stages of the language) left to be determined by
the poet’s sense of harmony or euphony.</p>

<p><a name="section6" id="section6"></a>
§ <b>6.</b> Before going further it will be well to define exactly the
meaning of the word <em>accent</em>, and to give an account of its different
uses. Accent is generally defined as ‘the stronger emphasis put on
a syllable, the stress laid on it’, or, as Sweet<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> puts it, ‘the
comparative force with which the separate syllables of a sound-group
are pronounced.’ According to Brücke<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> it is produced by increasing
the pressure of the breath. The stronger the pressure with which the
air passes from the lungs through the glottis, the louder will be the
tone of voice, the<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_5" id="Pg_5" title="5"></a> louder will be the sound of the consonants which
the stream of air produces in the cavity of the mouth. This increase of
tone and sound is what is called ‘accent’. Brücke seems to use tone and
sound as almost synonymous, but in metric we must distinguish between
them. Sound (<em>sonus</em>) is the more general, tone (τόνος)
the more specific expression. Sound, in this general sense, may have
a stronger or weaker tone. This strengthening of the tone is usually,
not invariably, accompanied by a rise in the pitch of the voice, just
as the weakening of the tone is accompanied by a lowering of the pitch.
In the Teutonic languages these variations of stress or accent serve to
bring into prominence the relative importance logically of the various
syllables of which words are composed. As an almost invariable rule, the
accent falls in these languages on the root-syllable, which determines
the sense of the word, and not on the formative elements which modify
that sense. This accent is an expiratory or stress accent.</p>

<p>It must be noted that we cannot, using the term in this sense, speak
of the accent of a monosyllabic word when isolated, but only of its
sound; nor can we use the word <em>accent</em> with reference to two or more
syllables in juxtaposition, when they are all uttered with precisely
the same force of voice. The term is significant only in relation
to a <em>variation</em> in the audible stress with which the different
syllables of a word or a sentence are spoken. This variation of stress
affects monosyllables only in connected speech, where they receive an
accentuation relative to the other words of the sentence. An absolute
uniformity of stress in a sentence is unnatural, though the amount
of variation in stress differs greatly in different languages. ‘The
distinctions of stress in some languages are less marked than in others.
Thus in French the syllables are all pronounced with a nearly uniform
stress, the strong syllables rising only a little above the general
level, its occurrence being also uncertain and fluctuating. This makes
Frenchmen unable without systematic training to master the accentuation
of foreign languages.’<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> English and the other Teutonic languages, on
the other hand, show a marked tendency to alternate weak and strong
stress.</p>

<p><a name="section7" id="section7"></a>
§ <b>7.</b> With regard to the function which it discharges in connected
speech, we may classify accent or stress under four different
categories. First comes what may be called the syntactical accent,
which marks the logical importance of a<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_6" id="Pg_6" title="6"></a> word in relation to other
words of the sentence. In a sentence like ‘the birds are singing’, the
substantive ‘birds’ has, as denoting the subject of the sentence, the
strongest accent; next in logical or syntactical importance comes the
word ‘singing’, denoting an activity of the subject, and this has a
comparatively strong accent; the auxiliary ‘are’ being a word of minor
importance is uttered with very little force of voice; the article
‘the’, being the least emphatic or significant, is uttered accordingly
with the slightest perceptible stress of all.</p>

<p>Secondly, we have the rhetorical accent, or as it might be called, the
subjective accent, inasmuch as it depends upon the emphasis which the
speaker wishes to give to that particular word of the sentence which he
desires to bring prominently before the hearer. Thus in the sentence,
‘you have done this,’ the rhetorical accent may fall on any of the four
words which the speaker desires to bring into prominence, e.g. ‘<em>yóu</em>
(and no one else) have done this,’ or ‘you <em>háve</em> done this (though you
deny it), or you have <em>dóne</em> this’ (you have not left it undone), or,
finally, ‘you have done <em>thís</em>’ (and not what you were told). This kind
of accent could also be termed the emphatic accent.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we have the rhythmical accent, which properly speaking belongs
to poetry only, and often gives a word or syllable an amount of stress
which it would not naturally have in prose, as, for instance, in the
following line of <cite>Hamlet</cite> (<span class="smcap">iii.</span> iii. <span class="locked">27)&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center iline">My lord, he’s going to his mother’s closet,</div>

<p>the unimportant word ‘to’ receives a stronger accent, due to the
influence of the rhythm, than it would have in prose. Similarly in the
following line of Chaucer’s <cite>Troilus and Cryseide</cite>, l. <span class="locked">1816&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center iline">For thóusandés his hóndes máden dýe,</div>

<p>the inflexional syllable <em>es</em> was certainly not ordinarily pronounced
with so much stress as it must have here under the influence of the
accent as determined by the rhythm of the line. Or again the word
‘writyng’, in the following couplet of Chaucer’s <cite>Canterbury Tales</cite>
(Prol. <span class="locked">325&ndash;6)&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
   <div class="line">Therto he couthe endite and make a thing,</div>
   <div class="line">Ther couthe no wight pynche at his writyng,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>was certainly not pronounced in ordinary speech with the same stress on
the last syllable as is here demanded both by the rhythm and rhyme.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_7" id="Pg_7" title="7"></a></p>

<p>As a rule, however, the rhythmical accent in English coincides with the
fourth kind of accent, the etymological or word-accent, which we now
have to deal with, and in greater detail.</p>

<p>Just as the different words of a sentence are pronounced, as we have
seen, with varying degrees of stress, so similarly the different
syllables of a single word are uttered with a varying intensity of
the force of the breath. One of the syllables of the individual word
is always marked off from the rest by a greater force of tone, and
these others are again differentiated from each other by subordinate
gradations of intensity of utterance, which may sometimes be so weak as
to lead to a certain amount of indistinctness, especially in English.
In the Teutonic languages, the root-syllable, as the most important
element of the word, and that which conveys the meaning, always bears
the chief accent, the other syllables bearing accents which are
subordinate to this chief accent. As the etymology of a word is always
closely associated with the form of the root-syllable, this syllabic
accent may be called the etymological accent. It naturally happens that
this syllabic accent coincides very often with the syntactical accent,
as the syntactical stress must be laid on the syllable which has the
etymological accent.</p>

<p>The degrees of stress on the various syllables may be as many in
number as the number of the syllables of the word in question. It is
sufficient, however, for purposes of metre and historical grammar, to
distinguish only four degrees of accent in polysyllabic words. These
four degrees of syllabic and etymological accent are as follows: 1.
the chief accent (<em>Hochton</em>, <em>Hauptton</em>); 2. the subsidiary accent
(<em>Tiefton</em>, <em>Nebenton</em>); 3. the absence of accent, or the unaccented
degree (<em>Tonlosigkeit</em>); 4. the mute degree, or absence of sound
(<em>Stummheit</em>). These last three varieties of accent arise from the
nature of the Teutonic accent, which is, it must always be remembered,
a stress-accent in which the volume of breath is expended mainly on the
first or chief syllable. The full meaning of these terms can most easily
be explained and understood by means of examples chosen either from
English or German, whose accentual basis is essentially the same. In the
word, <em>wonderful</em>, the first syllable has the chief accent (1), the last
has the subsidiary accent (2), and the middle syllable is unaccented
(3). The fourth or mute degree may be seen in such a word as <em>wondrous</em>,
shortened from <em>wonderous</em>. This fuller form may still be used, for
metrical purposes, as a trisyllable in which the first syllable has<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_8" id="Pg_8" title="8"></a> the
chief accent, the last the subsidiary accent, and the middle syllable
is unaccented, though audible. The usual pronunciation is, however, in
agreement with the usual spelling, disyllabic, and is <em>wondrous</em>; in
other words, the vowel <em>e</em> which originally formed the middle syllable,
has been dropped altogether in speech as in writing. From the point of
view of the accent, it has passed from the unaccented state to the state
of muteness; but may be restored to the unaccented, though audible,
state, wherever emphasis or metre requires the full syllable. We have
the line: ‘And it grew wondrous cold,’ for which we might have ‘The cold
grew wonderous’. In other cases the vowel is retained in writing but is
often dropped in colloquial pronunciation, or for metrical convenience.
Thus, in Shakespeare, we find sometimes the full <span class="locked">form&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line indent10">why the sepulchre</div>

</div>

<p>This passing of an unaccented syllable into complete muteness is very
frequent in English, as compared with other cognate languages. It
has led, in the historical development of the language, to a gradual
weakening, and finally, in many instances, to a total loss of the
inflexional endings. Very frequently, an inflexional vowel that has
become mute is retained in the current spelling; thus in the verbal
forms <em>gives</em>, <em>lives</em>, the <em>e</em> of the termination, though no longer
pronounced, is still retained in writing. Sometimes, in poetical texts,
it is omitted, but its position is indicated by an apostrophe, as in the
spellings <em>robb’d</em>, <em>belov’d</em>. In many words, on the other hand, the
silent vowel has ceased to be written, as in <em>grown</em>, <em>sworn</em>, of which
the original forms were <em>growen</em>, <em>sworen</em></p>

<p><a name="section8" id="section8"></a>
§ <b>8.</b> Written marks to indicate the position of the accent were
employed in early German poetry as early as the first half of the
ninth century, when they were introduced, it is supposed, by Hrabanus
Maurus of Fulda and his pupil Otfrid. The similar marks that are found
in certain Early English MSS., as the <cite>Ormulum</cite>, are usually signs of
vowel-quantity. They may possibly have sometimes been intended to denote
stress, but their use for this purpose is so irregular and uncertain
that they give little help towards determining the varying degrees of
accent in<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_9" id="Pg_9" title="9"></a> words during the earliest stages of the language. For this
purpose we must look for other and less ambiguous means, and these
are found (in the case of Old English words and forms) first, in the
alliteration, secondly, in comparison with related words of the other
Teutonic languages, and, thirdly, in the development in the later stages
of English itself. After the Norman Conquest, the introduction of rhyme,
and of new forms of metre imitated from the French and mediaeval Latin
poetry, affords further help in investigating the different degrees of
syllabic accent in Middle English words. None of these means, however,
can be considered as yielding results of absolute certainty, chiefly
because during this period the accentuation of the language was passing
through a stage of transition or compromise between the radically
different principles which characterize the Romanic and Teutonic
families of languages. This will be explained more fully in a subsequent
chapter.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this period of fluctuation the fundamental law of
accentuation remained unaltered, namely, that the chief accent falls on
the root of the word, which is in most cases the first syllable. For
purposes of notation the acute (´) will be used in this work to denote
the chief accent, the grave (`) the subsidiary accent of the single
word; to indicate the rhythmical or metrical accent the acute alone will
be sufficient.</p>

<p><a name="section9" id="section9"></a>
§ <b>9.</b> In English poetry, as in the poetry of the other Teutonic
nations, the rhythmical accent coincides normally with the syllabic or
etymological accent, and this, therefore, determines and regulates the
rhythm. In the oldest form of Teutonic poetry, the original alliterative
line, the rhythm is indicated by a definite number of strongly accented
syllables, accompanied by a less definite number of syllables which
do not bear the same emphatic stress. This principle of versification
prevails not only in Old English and Old and Middle High German poetry,
but also, to a certain extent, in the period of Middle English, where,
in the same manner, the number of beats or accented syllables indicates
the number of ‘feet’ or metrical units, and a single strongly accented
syllable can by itself constitute a ‘foot’. This practice is a feature
which distinguishes early English and German poetry, not only from
the classical poetry, in which a foot or measure must consist of at
least two syllables, but also from that of the Romanic, modern German,
and modern English languages, which has been influenced by classical
example, and in which, accordingly, a foot must contain one accented and
at least one unaccented syllable following one<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_10" id="Pg_10" title="10"></a> another in a regular
order. The classical terms ‘foot’ and ‘measure’ have, in their strict
sense, relation to the quantity of the syllables, and can therefore
be applied to the modern metres only by analogy. In poetry which is
based on the principle of accent or stress, the proper term is <em>bar</em>
(in German <em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Takt</em>). The general resemblances between modern accentual
and ancient quantitative metres are, however, so strong, that it is
hardly desirable to discontinue the application of old and generally
understood technical terms of the classical versification to modern
metres, provided the fundamental distinction between quantity and accent
is always borne in mind.</p>

<p>Setting aside for the present the old Teutonic alliterative line, in
which a ‘bar’ might permissibly consist of a single syllable, we may
retain the names of the feet of the classical quantitative versification
for the ‘bars’ of modern versification, using them in modified senses. A
group consisting of one unaccented followed by an accented syllable may
be called an <em>iambus</em>; one accented followed by an unaccented syllable a
<em>trochee</em>; two unaccented syllables followed by an accented syllable an
<em>anapaest</em>; one accented syllable followed by two unaccented syllables
a <em>dactyl</em>. These four measures might also be described according to
the length of the intervals separating the accents, and according as
the rhythm is <em>ascending</em> (passing from an unaccented to an accented
syllable) or <em>descending</em> (passing from an accented to an unaccented
syllable). We should then have the terms, (1) <em>ascending disyllabic</em>
(iambus), (2) <em>descending disyllabic</em> (trochee), (3) <em>ascending
trisyllabic</em> (anapaest), and (4) <em>descending trisyllabic</em> (dactyl).<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
But we may agree with Prof. Mayor that ‘it is certainly more convenient
to speak of iambic than of ascending disyllabic’.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It is, however,
only in the case of these four feet or measures that it is desirable to
adhere to the terminology of the ancient metres, and as a matter of fact
iambus, trochee, anapaest, and dactyl are the only names of classical
feet that are commonly recognized in English prosody.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> As to the
employment in the treatment of English metre of less familiar technical
terms derived from classical prosody, we agree with Prof. Mayor, when
he says: ‘I can sympathize with Mr. Ellis in his objection to the
classicists who would force upon us such terms as <em>choriambic</em> and
<em>proceleusmatic</em> to explain the rhythm of Milton. I do not <a class="pagenum" name="Pg_11" id="Pg_11" title="11"></a>deny that
the effect of his rhythm might sometimes be represented by such terms;
but if we seriously adopt them to explain his metre, we are attempting
an impossibility, to express in technical language the infinite variety
of measured sound which a genius like Milton could draw out of the
little five-stringed instrument on which he chose to play.’ The use of
these and other classical terms is justifiable only when we have to deal
with professed imitations of ancient forms of verse in English.</p>

<p>Whatever names may be chosen to denote the metrical forms, the <em>measure</em>
or <em>foot</em> always remains the unity which is the basis of all modern
metrical systems, and of all investigation into metre. For a line or
verse is built up by the succession of a limited number of feet or
measures, equal or unequal. With regard to the limit of the number of
feet permissible in a line or verse, no fixed rule can be laid down.
In no case must a line contain more feet than the ear may without
difficulty apprehend as a rhythmic whole; or, if the number of feet is
too great for this, the line must be divided by a <em>pause</em> or <em>break</em>
(caesura) into two or more parts which we may then call rhythmical
<em>sections</em>. This break is a characteristic mark of the typical Old
English alliterative line, which is made up of two rhythmical sections.
The structure of this verse was at one time obscured through the
practice of printing each of these sections by itself as a short line;
but Grimm’s example is now universally followed, and the two sections
are printed as parts of one long line.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Before entering into a
detailed consideration of the alliterative long line, it will be needful
to make a few general remarks on rhyme and its different species.</p>

<p><a name="section10" id="section10"></a>
§ <b>10.</b> Modern metre is not only differentiated from metre of the
classical languages by the principle of <em>accent</em> as opposed to
<em>quantity</em>; it has added a new metrical principle foreign to the ancient
systems. This principle is Rhyme. Instances of what looks like rhyme are
found in the classical poets from Homer onwards, but they are sporadic,
and are probably due to <span class="locked">accident.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Rhyme was not in use as an accessory to metre in Latin till the
quantitative principle had given way to the accentual principle in the
later hymns of the Church, and it has passed thence into all European
systems of metre.</p>

<p>In our poetry it serves a twofold purpose: it is used either simply
as an ornament, or as a tie to connect single lines into <a class="pagenum" name="Pg_12" id="Pg_12" title="12"></a>the larger
metrical unity of stanza or stave, by the recurrence of similar sounds
at various intervals.</p>

<p>In its widest sense rhyme is an agreement or consonance of sounds in
syllables or words, and falls into several subdivisions, according to
the extent and position of this agreement. As to its position, this
consonance may occur in the beginning of a syllable or word, or in the
middle, or in both middle and end at the same time. As to its extent,
it may comprehend one or two or more syllables. Out of these various
possibilities of likeness or consonance there arise three chief kinds
of rhyme in this wide sense, alliteration, assonance, and end-rhyme, or
rhyme simply in the more limited and usual acceptation of the word.</p>

<p><a name="section11" id="section11"></a>
§ <b>11.</b> This last, end-rhyme, or full-rhyme, or rhyme proper, consists
in a perfect agreement or consonance of syllables or words except in
their initial sounds, which as a rule are different. Generally speaking,
the agreement of sounds falls on the last accented syllable of a word,
or on the last accented syllable and a following unaccented syllable or
syllables. End-rhyme or full-rhyme seems to have arisen independently
and without historical connexion in several nations, but as far as
our present purpose goes we may confine ourselves to its development
in Europe among the nations of Romanic speech at the beginning of the
Middle Ages. Its adoption into all modern literature is due to the
extensive use made of it in the hymns of the Church. Full-rhyme or
end-rhyme therefore is a characteristic of modern European poetry, and
though it cannot be denied that unrhymed verse, or blank verse, is much
used in English poetry, the fact remains that this metre is an exotic
product of the Renaissance, and has never become thoroughly popular. Its
use is limited to certain kinds of poetic composition, whereas rhyme
prevails over the wider part of the realm of modern poetry.</p>

<p><a name="section12" id="section12"></a>
§ <b>12.</b> The second kind of rhyme (taking the word in its broader sense),
namely, vocalic assonance, is of minor importance in the treatment of
English metre. It consists in a similarity between the vowel-sounds
only of different words; the surrounding consonants do not count. The
following groups of words are assonant together: <em>give</em>, <em>thick</em>,
<em>fish</em>, <em>win</em>; <em>sell</em>, <em>step</em>, <em>net</em>; <em>thorn</em>, <em>storm</em>, <em>horse</em>. This
kind of rhyme was very popular among the Romanic nations, and among them
alone. Its first beginnings are found in the Latin ecclesiastical hymns,
and these soon developed into real or full-rhyme.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> It <a class="pagenum" name="Pg_13" id="Pg_13" title="13"></a>passed thence
into Provençal, Old French, and Spanish poetry, and has continued in use
in the last named. It is very rarely found in English verse, it has in
fact never been used deliberately, as far as we know, except in certain
recent experiments in metre. Where it does seem to occur it is safest to
look upon it as imperfect rhyme only. Instances are found in the Early
English metrical romances, Lives of Saints, and popular ballad poetry,
where the technique of the metre is not of a high order; examples such
as <em>flete</em>, <em>wepe</em>; <em>brake</em>, <em>gate</em>; <em>slepe</em>, <em>ymete</em> from <cite>King Horn</cite>
might be looked on as assonances, but were probably intended for real
rhymes. The consistent use of the full-rhyme being difficult, the poets,
in such instances as these, contented themselves with the simpler
harmony between the vowels alone, which represents a transition stage
between the older rhymeless alliterative verse, and the newer Romanic
metres with real and complete rhyme. Another possible form of assonance,
in which the consonants alone agree while the vowels may differ, might
be called <em>consonantal assonance</em> as distinguished from <em>vocalic
assonance</em>, or assonance simply. This form of assonance is not found in
English poetry, though it is employed in Celtic and Icelandic <span class="locked">metres.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="section13" id="section13"></a>
§ <b>13.</b> The third species of rhyme, to use the word still in its widest
sense, is known as alliteration (German <em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Stabreim</em> or <em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Anreim</em>). It is
common to all Teutonic nations, and is found fully developed in the
oldest poetical monuments of Old Norse, Old High German, Old Saxon, and
Old English. Even in classical poetry, especially in the remains of
archaic Latin, it is not unfrequently met with, but serves only as a
means for giving to combinations of words a rhetorical emphasis, and is
not a formal principle of the metre bound by strict rules, as it is in
Teutonic poetry. Alliteration consists in a consonance or agreement of
the sounds at the beginning of a word or syllable, as in <em>love</em> and
<em>liking</em>, <em>house</em> and <em>home</em>, <em>woe</em> and <em>weal</em>. The alliteration of
vowels and diphthongs has this peculiarity that the agreement need
not be exact as in ‛apt alliteration’s artful aid’, but can exist, at
least in the oldest stages of the language, between all vowels
indiscriminately. Thus in the oldest English not only were <em>ellen</em> and
<em>ende</em>, <em>ǣnig</em> and <em>ǣr</em>, <em>ēac</em> and <em>ēage</em> alliterations, but <em>age</em> and
<em>īdel</em>, <em>ǣnig</em> and <em>ellen</em>, <em>eallum</em> and <em>æðelingum</em> were employed in
the strictest forms of verse as words which perfectly alliterated with
each other.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_14" id="Pg_14" title="14"></a></p>

<p>This apparent confusion of vowel-sounds so different in their quantity
and quality is probably to be explained by the fact that originally in
English, as now in German, all the vowels were preceded by a ‘glottal
catch’ which is the real alliterating sound.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The harmony or
consonance of the unlike vowels is hardly perceptible in Modern English
and does not count as alliteration.</p>

<p>The most general law of the normal alliterative line is that three or at
least two of the four strongly accented syllables which occur in every
long line (two in each section) must begin with an alliterative letter,
for example, in the following Old English lines:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>w</b>ereda <b>w</b>uldorcining | wordum hērigen. <span class="attrib">Gen. 2.</span></div>

    <div class="line"><b>m</b>ōdum lufien | he is <b>m</b>ægna spēd. <span class="attrib">Gen. 3.</span></div>

    <div class="line"><b>æ</b>sc bið <b>o</b>ferhēah | <b>e</b>ldum dȳre.<span class="attrib">Run. 26.</span></div>

   <div class="line">on <b>a</b>ndsware | and on <b>e</b>lne strong. <span class="attrib">Gū. 264.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>or in early Modern English:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">For <b>m</b>yschefe will <b>m</b>ayster us | yf <b>m</b>easure us forsake.<span class="attrib">Skelton, Magnif. 156.</span></div>
    <div class="line">How sodenly <b>w</b>orldly| <b>w</b>elth doth dekay.<span class="attrib">ib. 1518.</span></div>
    <div class="line">I am your <b>e</b>ldest son| <b>E</b>sau by name.<span class="attrib">Dodsl. Coll. ii. 249.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The history of the primitive alliterative line follows very different
lines of development in the various Teutonic nations. In Old High
German, after a period in which the strict laws of the verse were
largely neglected, it was abandoned in favour of rhyme by Otfrid (circa
868). In Old English it kept its place as the only form of verse
for all classes of poetical composition, and continued in use, even
after the introduction of Romanic forms of metre, during the Middle
English period, and did not totally die out till the beginning of the
seventeenth century. The partial revival of it is due to the increased
interest in Old English studies, but has been confined largely to
translations. As an occasional rhetorical or stylistic ornament of both
rhymed and unrhymed verse, alliteration has always been made use of by
English poets.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="subtitle">THE ALLITERATIVE VERSE IN OLD ENGLISH</span></h3>

<p><a name="section14" id="section14"></a>
§ <b>14. General remarks.</b> It is highly probable that alliteration
was the earliest kind of poetic form employed by the English people.
There is no trace in the extant monuments of the language of any
more primitive or simpler system. A predilection for alliteration
existed even in prose, as in the names of heroes and families like
Scyld and Sceaf, Hengist and Horsa, Finn and Folcwald, pairs that
alliterate in the same way as the family names of other Teutonic
nations: the names of the three sons of Mannus, Ingo, Isto, Irmino,
conform to this type.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The earliest monuments of Old English
poetry, as the fragmentary hymn of Cædmon in the More MS. (Cambridge)
and the inscription on the Ruthwell Cross, are composed in the long
alliterative line. The great body of Old English verse is in this
metre, the only exceptions being the ‘Rhyming Poem’ (in the <cite>Exeter
Book</cite>),<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and a few other late pieces, in which alliteration and
rhyme are combined. This Old English poetry, therefore, together with
the Old Norse and Old Saxon remains (the <cite>Heliand</cite> with 5,985 lines,
and the recently discovered fragment of the Old Saxon <cite>Genesis</cite>, edited
by Zangemeister and Braune, 1894, with 335 lines), affords ample and
trustworthy material for determining the laws of the alliterative verse
as used by the Teutonic nations. In comparison with these the remains
of Old High German alliterative verse are both scanty and lax in
structure.</p>

<p><a name="section15" id="section15"></a>
§ <b>15. Theories on the metrical form of the alliterative line.</b>
Notwithstanding their comparative scantiness, the Old High German
fragments (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hildebrandslied</cite>, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wessobrunner Gebet</cite>, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Muspilli</cite> and two
magical formulae, with a total of some 110 lines) formed the basis
of the earliest theories of the laws of the accentuation and general
character of the original alliterative line. They were assumed to have
preserved the features of the<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_16" id="Pg_16" title="16"></a> primitive metre, and conclusions were
drawn from them as to the typical form of the verse. When examined
closely, the Old High German remains (and this is true also of the
longer monuments in Old Saxon) are found to differ widely from Old
Norse and Old English verse in one respect. While the general and
dominating features of the line remain the same, the Old High German
and Old Saxon lines are much longer than the Old Norse or Old English
lines. In Old Norse or Old English the half line frequently contains no
more than four syllables, in marked contrast to Old High German and Old
Saxon, where the half line or section is considerably longer.</p>

<p>The first attempt at a theory of the metrical structure of the
alliterative line was made by Lachmann. He based his theory on the
form of verse created by Otfrid, in imitation of Latin models, which
consists of a long line of eight accents, separated by leonine rhyme
into two sections each of four accents alternately strong and weak.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
The laws of the rhyming and strophic verse of Otfrid were applied by
Lachmann to the purely alliterative verses of the Old High German
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hildebrandslied</cite>, and this system of scanning was further applied by
his followers to the alliterative verse of Old English, the true nature
of which was long misunderstood on the Continent. In England itself a
sounder view of the native alliterative verse was propounded by Bishop
Percy as early as 1765, in his <cite>Essay on the Metre of Pierce Plowman</cite>
published along with his well-known <cite>Reliques of Ancient English
Poetry</cite>, not to speak of the earlier writings of G. Gascoigne (1575)
and James VI (1585). But the number and authority of some of Lachmann’s
followers are such that some detailed account of their theories must be
<span class="locked">given.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="section16" id="section16"></a>
§ <b>16. The four-beat theory</b> of the alliterative verse, based on
the assumption that each of the two sections must have had four
accented syllables to bring out a regular rhythm, was applied by
Lachmann himself only to the Old High German <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hildebrandslied</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
while on the other hand he recognized a freer variety with two chief
accents only in each section, for the Old Norse, Old Saxon, and Old
English. The four-beat theory was further applied to the Old High
German <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Muspilli</cite> by<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_17" id="Pg_17" title="17"></a> Bartsch,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and to the rest of the smaller
relics of Old High German verse by Müllenhoff.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The next step was
to bring the Old Saxon <cite>Heliand</cite> and the Old English <cite>Beowulf</cite> under
this system of scansion; and this was taken by M. Heyne in 1866 and
1867. But the metre of <cite>Beowulf</cite> does not differ from that of the
other alliterative poems in Old English, and these in their turn
were claimed for the four-beat theory by Schubert,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> but with this
important modification, made before by Bartsch, that side by side with
the usual four-beat sections there were also to be found sections of
three beats only. One obvious difficulty in applying the theory of
four strongly marked beats to the Old English half-lines or hemistichs
is this, that in Old English these hemistichs consist in very many
cases of not more than four syllables altogether, each one of which
would on this theory have an accent to itself. To meet these cases E.
Jessen<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> started the theory that in certain cases pauses had to be
substituted for ‘beats not realized’. A further modification of the
four-beat doctrine was introduced by Amelung,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> who maintained that
in the metre of the <cite>Heliand</cite> each hemistich had two primary or chief
accents and two secondary or subordinate accents. In order to bring the
verse under this scansion he assumes that certain syllables admitted
of being lengthened. He further regarded the <cite>Heliand</cite> verse as a
metre regulated by strict time, and not as a measure intended for free
recitation and depending only on the number of accented syllables.</p>

<p>A few other more recent attempts at solving the problem must be
mentioned before we pass on to explain and discuss Sievers’s system in
the next paragraph. The views of Prof. Möller of Copenhagen<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> have
found an adherent in Lawrence, from whose book<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> we may quote the
following summary of Möller’s theory. According to Prof. Möller the
hemistich consists theoretically of two measures (<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Takte</em>), each of four
<em>morae</em> <span class="scansion">×́××̀×</span> (a <em>mora</em>, <span class="scansion">×</span>, being the time required for one short
syllable), and therefore the whole verse of four measures, thus:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="scansion">×́××̀×|×́××̀×||×́××̀×|×́××̀×||.</span></p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_18" id="Pg_18" title="18"></a></p>

<p>Where, in a verse, the <em>morae</em> are not filled by actual syllables, their
time must be occupied by rests (represented by r*) in reciting, by
holding on the note in singing.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> A long syllable, ——, is equivalent
to two <em>morae</em>. Thus v. 208 of <cite>Beowulf</cite></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">súnd-wùdu. sṓhtè. sécg. wī́sàde.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>would be symbolically represented as follows:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="scansion">–́×̀×|–́×̀</span> r <span class="scansion">||–́</span> rr <span class="scansion">|–́×̀×.</span></p>

<p>According to this system the pause at <em>secg</em> will be twice as long as
that at <em>sōhte</em>, whilst at <em>wudu</em> there will be no real pause and the
point will merely indicate the end of the measure.</p>

<p>Others reverted to the view of Bartsch and Schubert that there could
be hemistichs with only three accents alongside of the hemistichs with
the normal number of four. Among these may be mentioned H. Hirt,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
whose view is that three beats to a hemistich is the normal number,
four being less usual, the long line having thus mostly six beats,
against the eight of Lachmann’s theory; K. Fuhr,<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> who holds that
every hemistich, whether it stands first or second in the verse, has
four beats if the last syllable is unaccented (<em>klingend</em>; in that case
the final unaccented syllable receives a secondary rhythmical accent,
for example, <em>fḗond máncýnnès</em>) and has three beats if it is accented
(<em>stumpf</em>, for example, <em>fýrst fórð gewā́t</em>, or <em>múrnénde mṓd</em>, &amp;c.);
and B. ten Brink,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> who calls the hemistichs with four beats full or
‘complete’ (e.g. <em>hȳ́ràn scóldè</em>, but admits hemistichs with three beats
only, calling them ‘incomplete’ from the want of a secondary accent
(e.g. <em>twélf wíntra tī́d, hā́m gesṓhte</em>, &amp;c.). The four-beat theory
was reverted to by M. Kaluza, who endeavours to reconcile it with the
results of Sievers and others.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> A somewhat similar view is taken by
R. Kögel.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_19" id="Pg_19" title="19"></a> Trautmann<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> takes Amelung’s view that certain words and
syllables must be lengthened in order to get the four accented syllables
necessary for each hemistich. Thus, according to Trautmann’s scansion,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">sprécað fǽgeré befóran</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>would run <span class="scansion">×́×|×́×|×́×|⏑́×</span> and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">ónd þú him méte sýlest</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>would also have the formula <span class="scansion">×́×|×́×|×́×|⏑́×</span>,</p>

<p><em>ond</em> being protracted to two units. Another instance of this
lengthening would, on this theory, occur in the final syllable of
the word <em>radores</em> in the hemistich <em>únder rádorès rýne</em>, while in
a section like <em>gūð-rinc monig</em>, or <em>of fold-grǽfe</em>, the words
<em>rinc</em> and <em>of</em> would be extended to two, and <em>gūð</em> and <em>fold</em> would
each be extended to four units, in order to fit in with the scansion
<span class="scansion">×́×|×́×|×́×|⏑́×</span>. Most of the partisans of the four-beat
theory for the hemistich agree in making two of these beats primary,
and two secondary; Trautmann, however, does not seem to recognize any
such difference in the force of the four accents. All the supporters
of the four-beat theory have this in common, that the rhythm of the
verse is assumed to be based on time (<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">taktierend</em>), but in other
respects differ widely from each other; Hirt, for example, in his
last discussion of the subject,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> claiming that his own view is
fundamentally different from that of Kaluza, which again he looks on as
at variance with those of Möller and Heusler.</p>

<p><a name="section17" id="section17"></a>
§ <b>17. The two-beat theory</b>, on the other hand, is that each of the
two hemistichs of the alliterative line need have only two accented
syllables. In England this view was taken by two sixteenth-century
writers on verse, George Gascoigne<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> who quotes the line,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_20" id="Pg_20" title="20"></a></p>

<p>In 1765, Percy, in his <cite>Essay on Pierce Plowman’s Visions</cite>, pointed
out ‘that the author of this poem will not be found to have invented
any new mode of versification, as some have supposed, but only to have
retained that of the old Saxon and Gothick poets, which was probably
never wholly laid aside, but occasionally used at different intervals’.
After quoting<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> two Old Norse, he gives two Old English <span class="locked">verses:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="lines-container">

  </div>
</div>

<p>he continues: ‘Now if we examine the versification of Pierce Plowman’s
Visions’ (from which he quotes the <span class="locked">beginning&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

  </div>
</div>

<p>‘we shall find it constructed exactly by these rules’, which are, in
his own words, ‘that every distich [i.e. complete long line] should
contain at least three words beginning with the same letter or sound;
two of these correspondent sounds might be placed either in the first or
second line of the distich, and one in the other, but all three were not
regularly to be crowded into one line.’ He then goes on to quote further
specimens of alliterative verse from <cite>Pierce the Ploughman’s Crede</cite>,
<cite>The Sege of Jerusalem</cite>, <cite>The Chevalere Assigne</cite>, <cite>Death and Liffe</cite> and
<cite>Scottish Fielde</cite>, which latter ends with a rhyming couplet:</p>

    <div class="line">That hath hearkened me heare | or heard my tale.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Taken as a whole his dissertation on the history of alliterative verse
is remarkably correct, and his final remarks are noteworthy:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>Thus we have traced the alliterative measure so low as the
  sixteenth century. It is remarkable that all such poets as used this
  kind of metre, retained along with it many peculiar Saxon idioms,
  particularly such as were appropriated to poetry: <em>this deserves the
  attention of those who are desirous to recover the laws of the ancient
  Saxon poesy, usually given up as inexplicable:</em> I am of opinion that
  they will find what they seek in the metre of Pierce Plowman. About
  the beginning of the sixteenth century this kind of versification
  began to change its form; the author of <cite>Scottish Field</cite>, we
  see, concludes his poem with a couplet of rhymes; this was an
  innovation<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> that did but prepare the way for the general admission
  of that <a class="pagenum" name="Pg_21" id="Pg_21" title="21"></a>more modish ornament. When rhyme began to be superadded,
  all the niceties of alliteration were at first retained with it: the
  song of Little John Nobody exhibits this union very closely.... To
  proceed; the old uncouth verse of the ancient writers would no longer
  go down without the more fashionable ornament of rhyme, and therefore
  rhyme was superadded. This correspondence of final sounds engrossing
  the whole attention of the poet and fully satisfying the reader, the
  internal imbellishment of alliteration was no longer studied, and thus
  was this kind of metre at length swallowed up and lost in our common
  burlesque alexandrine, now never used but in songs and pieces of low
  humour, as in the following ballad; and that well-known doggrel:</p>

  <p class="center">‘A cobler there was and he lived in a stall’.</p>
</div>

<p>Now it is clear that this verse is of exactly the same structure as the
verses quoted by Gascoigne:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line ital">No wight in this world that wealth can attayne,</div>
    <div class="line ital">Ùnléss hè bèléue, thàt áll ìs bùt vaýne,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>where the scheme of accents is Gascoigne’s own, showing that he read
them as verses of four accents in all, two in each hemistich. They show
the same rhythmical structure as the ‘tumbling’ or alliterative line
given by James VI<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> (1585):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Fetching fude for to feid it fast furth of the Farie,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>and described by him as having ‘twa [feit, i.e. syllables] short,
and ane lang throuch all the lyne’, in other words with four accented
syllables in the verse.</p>

<p>Percy detected very acutely that the Middle English alliterative line
stood in close connexion with the Old English alliterative line, and
suggested as highly probable that the metre of <cite>Pierce Plowman</cite> would
give a key to the rhythm of that older form of verse, which would have
to be read with two accented syllables in the hemistich, and therefore
four in the whole line.</p>

<p>Had this essay of Percy’s been known to Lachmann’s followers, many
of the forced attempts at reconciling the Old English verse with a
scheme that involved a fixed number of syllables in the line would not
have been made. Lachmann himself, it must be remembered, admitted the
two-beat scansion for Old Norse, Old Saxon, and Old English. Meanwhile
other investigators were at work on independent lines. In 1844 A.
Schmeller, the editor of the <cite>Heliand</cite>, formulated the law that, in
the Teutonic languages, it is the force with which the different
syllables are uttered that regulates the rhythm of the verse, and not
the <a class="pagenum" name="Pg_22" id="Pg_22" title="22"></a>number or length of the syllables (which are of minor importance),
and established the fact that this alliterative verse was not meant to
be sung but to be recited.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> He does not enter into the details of
the rhythm of the verse, except by pointing out the two-beat cadence
of each section. Somewhat later, W. Wackernagel<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> declared himself
in favour of the two-beat theory for all Teutonic alliterative verse.
In every hemistich of the verse there are according to Wackernagel two
syllables with a grammatical or logical emphasis, and consequently a
strong accent, the number of less strongly accented syllables not being
fixed. The two-beat theory was again ably supported by F. Vetter<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
and by K. Hildebrand, who approached the subject by a study of the Old
Norse alliterative verse,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and by M. Rieger in his instructive essay
on Old Saxon and Old English versification.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> In this essay Rieger
pointed out the rules prevailing in the poetry of those two closely
related Teutonic nations, dealt with the distribution and quality of the
alliteration, the relation of the alliteration to the noun, adjective,
and verb, and to the order of words, with the caesura and the close of
the verse, and, finally, with the question of the accented syllables and
the limits of the use of unaccented syllables.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Other scholars, as
Horn, Ries, and Sievers, contributed further elucidations of the details
of this metre on the basis of Rieger’s <span class="locked">researches.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Next to Rieger’s short essay the most important contribution made to
the accurate and scientific study of alliterative verse was that made
by Sievers in his article on the rhythm of the Germanic alliterative
verse.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> In this he shows, to use his own words, ‘that a statistical
classification of groups of words with<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_23" id="Pg_23" title="23"></a> their natural accentuation in
both sections of the alliterative line makes it clear that this metre,
in spite of its variety, is not so irregular as to the unaccented
syllables at the beginning or in the middle of the verse as has been
commonly thought, but that it has a range of a limited number of
definite forms which may be all reduced to five primary types.’ These
five types or chief variations in the relative position of the accented
and unaccented syllables are, as Sievers points out, of such a nature
and so arbitrarily combined in the verse, that they cannot possibly be
regarded as symmetrical feet of a line evenly measured and counted by
the number of syllables. ‘The fundamental principle, therefore, of the
structure of the alliterative line, as we find it in historical times,
is that of a free change of rhythm which can only be understood if the
verse was meant to be recited, not to be sung.’<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Soon after the
publication of Sievers’s essay on the rhythm of the Germanic verse, the
first part of which contained a complete classification of all the forms
of the line occurring in <cite>Beowulf</cite>, other scholars applied his method
and confirmed his results by examining in detail the other important
Old English texts; Luick dealt with <cite>Judith</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Frucht with the poems
of Cynewulf,<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and Cremer with <cite>Andreas</cite>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Sievers himself,
after contributing to the pages of Paul’s <cite>Grundriss der germanischen
Philologie</cite> a concise account of his theories and results, expounded
them in greater detail in his work on Old Germanic Metre<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> in which
he emphasizes the fact that his five-type theory cannot properly be
called a theory at all, but is simply an expression of the rules of the
alliterative verse obtained by a statistical method of observation. In
spite of the criticisms of his opponents, Möller, Heusler, Hirt, Fuhr,
and others, he maintained his former views. In principle these views are
in conformity with the manner of reading or scanning the alliterative
verse explained by English writers on the subject from the sixteenth
century downwards, though their terminology naturally is not the same as
Sievers’s. We may, therefore, accept them on the whole as sound.</p>

<p>It would be out of place here to enter into the question<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_24" id="Pg_24" title="24"></a> of prehistoric
forms of Teutonic poetry. It will be enough to say that in Sievers’s
opinion a primitive form of this poetry was composed in strophes or
stanzas, intended to be sung and not merely to be recited; that at
a very early period this sung strophic poetry gave way to a recited
stichic form suitable to epic narrations; and that his five-type forms
are the result of this development. As all the attempts to show that
certain Old English poems were originally composed in strophic form<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
have proved failures, we may confidently assent to Sievers’s conclusion
that the alliterative lines (as a rule) followed one upon another in
unbroken succession, and that in historic times they were not composed
in even and symmetrical measures (<em>taktierend</em>), and were not meant to
be sung to fixed tunes.</p>

<p>The impossibility of assuming such symmetrical measures for the Old
English poetry is evident from the mere fact that the end of the line
does not as a rule coincide with the end of the sentence, as would
certainly be the case had the lines been arranged in staves or stanzas
meant for singing. The structure of the alliterative line obeys only the
requirements of free recitation and is built up of two hemistichs which
have a rhythmical likeness to one another resulting from the presence
in each of two accented syllables, but which need not have, and as a
matter of fact very rarely have, complete identity of rhythm, because
the number and situation of the unaccented syllables may vary greatly in
the two sections.</p>

<p><a name="section18" id="section18"></a>
§ <b>18. Accentuation of Old English.</b> As the versification of Old
English is based on the natural accentuation of the language, it will
be necessary to state the laws of this accentuation before giving an
account of the five types to which the structure of the hemistich has
been reduced.</p>

<p>In simple polysyllables the chief or primary accent, in this work marked
by an acute (´), is as a rule on the root-syllable, and the inflexional
and other elements of the word have a less marked accent varying from
a secondary accent, here marked by a grave (`), to the weakest grade
of accent, which is generally left unmarked: thus <em>wúldor</em>, <em>héofon</em>,
<em>wī́tig</em>, <em>wúnode</em>, <em>ǽðelingas</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the alliterative line, as a general rule, only syllables with the
chief accent carry either the alliterating sounds or the four rhythmical
accents of the verse. All other syllables, even those <a class="pagenum" name="Pg_25" id="Pg_25" title="25"></a>with secondary
accent, count ordinarily as the ‘theses’ (<em>Senkungen</em>) of the verse<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">síndon þā <b>b</b>éarwas &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>b</b>lḗdum gehóngene</div>
    <div class="line"><b>w</b>lítigum <b>w</b>ǽstmum: &nbsp; &nbsp; þǣr nō wániað ṓ</div>
    <div class="line"><b>h</b>ā́lge under <b>h</b>éofonum &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>h</b>óltes frǽtwe.</div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="attribution">Phoenix 71&ndash;73.</div>

<p>In compound words (certain combinations with unaccented prefixes
excepted) the first element of the compound (which modifies or
determines the meaning of the second element) has the primary
accent, the second element having only a secondary accent, e.g.
<em>wúldor-cỳning</em>, <em>hḗah-sètl</em>, <em>sṓð-fæ̀st</em>.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> If therefore
the compound has, as is mostly the case, only one alliterative sound,
that alliteration must necessarily fall on the first part of the
compound:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>w</b>ī́tig <b>w</b>úldorcyning &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>w</b>órlde and héofona.<span class="attrib">Dan. 427.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes it happens that in hemistichs of no great length the second
part of the compound carries one of the two rhythmical accents of the
hemistich, e.g.</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">on <b>h</b>ḗah-sétle &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>h</b>éofones wáldend.<span class="attrib">Cri. 555.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>and in a particular form of alliteration<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> it may even contain one of
the alliterating sounds, as in the verse:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">hwæt! we <b>G</b>ā́r<b>d</b>éna &nbsp; &nbsp; in <b>g</b>ēar<b>d</b>águm.<span class="attrib">Beow. 1.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The less strongly accented derivational and inflexional suffixes, though
they are not allowed to alliterate, may occasionally have the rhythmical
accent, on condition that they immediately follow upon a long accented
syllable, e.g.</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">mid <b>W</b>ýlfíngum, &nbsp; &nbsp; þā hine <b>W</b>ára cýn. <span class="attrib">Beow. 461.</span></div>
    <div class="line">ne méahte ic æt <b>h</b>ílde  &nbsp; &nbsp; mid <b>H</b>rúntínge. <span class="attrib">ib. 1659.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The rhythmical value of syllables with a secondary accent will be
considered more fully later on.</p>

<p>These general rules for the accent of compound words formed of noun
+ noun or adjective + noun require modification for the cases where
a prefix (adverb or preposition) stands in close juxtaposition with
a verb or noun. The preposition standing before and depending on a
noun coalesces so closely<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_26" id="Pg_26" title="26"></a> with it that the two words express a single
notion, the noun having the chief accent, e.g. <em>onwég</em>, <em>āwég</em>
(away), <em>ætsómne</em> (together), <em>ofdū́ne</em> (down), <em>toníhte</em> (to-night),
<em>onmíddum</em> (amid); examples in verse are:</p>

<p>But while the prepositional prefix thus does not carry the alliteration
owing to its want of accent, some of the adverbs used in composition are
accented, others are unaccented, and others again may be treated either
way. When the adverbial prefix originally stood by itself side by side
with the verb, and may in certain cases still be disjoined from it, it
has then the primary accent, because it is felt as a modifying element
of the compound. When, however, the prefix and the verb have become so
intimately united as to express one single notion, the verb takes the
accent and the prefix is treated as proclitic, and there is a third
class of these compounds which are used indifferently with accent on the
prefix or on the verb.</p>

<p>Some of the commonest prefixes used in alliteration are<a class="fnanchor" name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57">[57]</a>: <em>and</em>,
<em>æfter</em>, <em>eft</em>, <em>ed</em>, <em>fore</em>, <em>forð</em>, <em>from</em>, <em>hider</em>, <em>in</em>, <em>hin</em>,
<em>mid</em>, <em>mis</em>, <em>niðer</em>, <em>ongēan</em>, <em>or</em>, <em>up</em>, <em>ūt</em>, <em>efne</em>, as in
compounds like <em>ándswarian</em>, <em>íngong</em>, <em>ǽfterweard</em>, &amp;c.:</p>

<p>When prepositions precede other prepositions or adverbs in composition,
the accent rests on that part of the whole compound which is felt to be
the most important. Such compounds fall into three classes: (i) if a
preposition or adverb is preceded by the prepositions <em>be</em>, <em>on</em>, <em>tō</em>,
<em>þurh</em>, <em>wið</em>, these latter are not accented, since they only slightly
modify the sense of the following adverb. Compounds of this kind
are: <em>beǣ́ftan</em>, <em>befóran</em>, <em>begéondan</em>, <em>behíndan</em>, <em>beínnan</em>, <em>benéoðan</em>,
<em>búfan</em>, <em>bútan</em>, <em>onúfan</em>, <em>onúppan</em>, <em>tōfóran</em>, <em>wiðínnan</em>, <em>wiðū́tan</em>,
<em>undernéoðan</em>.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Only the second part of the compound is allowed to
alliterate in these words:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">he <b>f</b>ḗāra súm &nbsp; &nbsp; be<b>f</b>óran géngde. <span class="attrib">Beow. 1412.</span></div>

<p>Most of these words do not seem to occur in the poetry.</p>

<p>(ii) In compounds of <em>þǣr</em> + preposition the preposition is accented
and takes the alliteration:</p>

<p>(iii) <em>weard</em>, as in <em>æfterweard</em>, <em>foreweard</em>, <em>hindanweard</em>,

<p><a name="section19" id="section19"></a>
§ <b>19. The secondary accent.</b> The secondary or subordinate accent is of
as great importance as the chief or primary accent in determining the
rhythmical character of the alliterative line. It is found in the
following classes of words:</p>

<p>(i) In all compounds of noun + noun, or adjective + noun, or adjective
+ adjective, the second element of the compound has the subordinate
accent, e.g. <em>hēah-sètl</em>, <em>gū́ð-rinc</em>, <em>hríng-nèt</em>, <em>sṓð-fæ̀st</em>.
Syllables with this secondary accent are necessary in certain cases
as links between the arsis and thesis, as in forms like <em>þégn
Hrṓðgā̀res</em> (<span class="scansion">–́|–́×̀×</span>) or <em>fýrst fórð gewā̀t</em> (<span class="scansion">–́|–́××̀</span>).</p>

<p>(ii) In proper names like <em>Hrṓðgā̀r</em>, <em>Bḗowùlf</em>, <em>Hýgelā̀c</em>,
this secondary accent may sometimes count as one of the four chief
metrical accents of the line, as in</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>b</b>éornas on <b>b</b>láncum &nbsp; &nbsp; þǣr wæs <b>B</b>éowúlfes.<span class="attrib">Beow. 857.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>contrasted with</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>é</b>orl Béowùlfes &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>é</b><em>alde lā́fe</em>. <span class="attrib"> Beow. 797.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>(iii) When the second element has ceased to be felt as a distinct
part of the compound, and is little more than a suffix, it loses the
secondary accent altogether; as <em>hlā́ford</em>, <em>ǣ́ghwylc</em>, <em>ínwit</em>, and
the large class of words compounded with -<em>līc</em> and <em>sum</em>.</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">þæt he <b>H</b>éardrḗde &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>h</b>lā́ford wǣ́re. <span class="attrib">Beow. 2375.</span></div>
    <div class="line"><b>l</b>úfsum and <b>l</b>ī́ðe &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>l</b>ḗofum monnum. <span class="attrib">Cri. 914.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>(iv) In words of three syllables, the second syllable when long and
following a long root-syllable with the chief accent, has, especially
in the early stage of Old English, a well-marked secondary accent:
thus, <em>ǣ́rèsta</em>, <em>ṓðèrra</em>, <em>sémnìnga</em>, <em>éhtènde</em>; the third syllable in
words of the form <em>ǽðelìnga</em> gets the same secondary accent. This
secondary accent can count as one of the four rhythmic accents of the
line, e.g.</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">þā <b>ǣ́</b>réstan <b>ǣ́</b>lda cýnnes.<span class="attrib">Gū. 948.</span></div>
    <div class="line"><b>s</b>ígefolca <b>s</b>wḗg oð þæt <b>s</b>émnínga.<span class="attrib">Beow. 644.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Words of this class, not compounded, are comparatively rare, but
compounds with secondary accent are frequent.</p>

<p>These second syllables with a marked secondary accent in the best
examples of Old English verse mostly form by themselves a member of the
verse, i.e. are not treated as simple theses as in certain compositions
of later date, e.g.</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">dȳ́gelra gescéafta. <span class="attrib">Creat. 18.</span></div>
    <div class="line">ā́genne brðor.<span class="attrib">Metr. ix. 28.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_29" id="Pg_29" title="29"></a></p>

<p>(v) After a long root-syllable of a trisyllabic word a short second
syllable (whether its vowel was originally short or long) may bear one
of the chief accents of the line, e.g. <em>bōcère</em>, <em>bíscòpe</em>:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">þǣr bíscéopas and bṓcéras. <span class="attrib">An. 607.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>or may stand in the thesis and be unaccented, as</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">gódes bísceope þā spræc gū́ðcýning. <span class="attrib">Gen. 2123.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This shows that in common speech these syllables had only a slight
secondary accent.</p>

<p>(vi) Final syllables (whether long or short) are as a rule not accented
even though a long root-syllable precede them.</p>

<p><a name="section20" id="section20"></a>
§ <b>20. Division and metrical value of syllables.</b> Some other points
must be noticed with reference to the division and metrical value of the
syllables of some classes of words.</p>

<p>The formative element <em>i</em> in the present stem of the second class
of weak verbs always counts as a syllable when it follows a long
root-syllable, thus <em>fund-i-an</em>, <em>fund-i-ende</em> not <em>fund-yan</em>, &amp;c. In
verbs with a short root-syllable it is metrically indifferent whether
this <em>i</em> is treated as forming a syllable by itself or coalescing as
a consonant with the following vowel, so that we may divide either
<em>ner-i-an,</em> or <em>ner-yan</em>; in verbs of the first and third class the
consonantal pronunciation was according to Sievers probably the usual
one, hence <em>neryan</em> (<em>nerian</em>), <em>lifyan</em> (<em>lifᵹan</em>), but for verbs of the
second class the syllable remained vocalic, thus <em>þolian</em><span class="locked">.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>In foreign names like <em>Assyria</em>, <em>Eusebius</em>, the <em>i</em> is generally
treated as a vowel, but in longer words possibly as a consonant, as
<em>Macedonya</em> (<em>Macedonia</em>). As to the epenthetic vowels developed from a
<em>w</em>, the question whether we are to pronounce <em>gearowe</em> or <em>gearwe</em>,
<em>bealowes</em> or <em>bealwes</em> cannot be decided by metre. Syllabic <em>l</em>,<em>m</em>, <em>n</em>
(<em>l̥</em>, <em>m̥</em>, <em>n̥</em>) following a short root-vowel lose their syllabic
character, thus <em>sĕtl</em>, <em>hræ̆gl</em>, <em>swĕfn</em> are monosyllables, but <em>er</em>
coming from original <em>r</em> as in <em>wæter</em>, <em>leger</em> may be
either consonantal or vocalic. After a long root-syllable vocalic
pronunciation is the rule, but occasionally words of this kind, as
<em>túngl</em>, <em>bṓsm</em>, <em>tā́cn</em>, are used as monosyllables, and the
<em>l</em>, <em>m</em>, and <em>n</em> are consonants. Hiatus is allowed; but in many
cases elision of an unaccented syllable takes place, though no fixed
rule can be laid down owing to the fluctuating number of unaccented
syllables permissible in the hemistich or whole line.<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_30" id="Pg_30" title="30"></a> In some cases
the metre requires us to expunge vowels which have crept into the
texts by the carelessness of copyists, e.g. we must write <em>ḗðles</em>
instead of <em>ḗðeles</em>, <em>éngles</em> instead of <em>éngeles</em>, <em>dḗofles</em>
instead of <em>dḗofeles</em>, and in other cases we must restore the older
and fuller forms such as <em>ṓðerra</em> for <em>ṓðrā</em>, <em>eṓwere</em>
for <em>ḗowre</em>.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The resolution of long syllables with the chief
accent in the arsis, and of long syllables with the secondary accent
in the thesis, affects very greatly the number of syllables in the
line. Instead of the one long syllable which as a rule bears one of the
four chief accents of the verse, we not unfrequently meet with a short
accented syllable plus an unaccented syllable either long or short
(<span class="scansion">⏑́×́</span>). This is what is termed the resolution of an accented syllable.
A word accordingly like <em>fároðe</em> with one short accented syllable and
two unaccented syllables has the same rhythmical value as <em>fṓron</em>
with one long accented and one unaccented syllable, or a combination
like <em>se þe wæs</em> is rhythmically equivalent to <em>sécg wæs</em>.</p>

<p><a name="section21" id="section21"></a>
§ <b>21.</b> We now come to <b>the structure of the whole alliterative line</b>.
The regular alliterative line or verse is made up of two hemistichs
or sections. These two sections are separated from each other by a
pause or break, but united by means of alliteration so that they form
a rhythmical unity. Each hemistich must have two syllables which
predominate over the rest in virtue of their logical and syntactical
importance and have on this account a stronger stress. These stressed
syllables, four in number for the whole line, count as the rhythmical
accents of the verse. The force given to these accented syllables is
more marked when they carry at the same time the alliteration, which
happens at least once in each hemistich, frequently twice in the first
and once in the second hemistich, and in a number of instances twice in
both hemistichs. The effect of the emphasis given to these four words or
syllables by the syntax, etymology, rhythm, and sometimes alliteration,
is that the other words and syllables may for metrical purposes be
looked upon as in comparison unaccented, even though they may have a
main or secondary word-accent.</p>

<p>In certain cases, in consequence of the particular structure of the
hemistich, there is found a rhythmical secondary accent, generally
coinciding with an etymological secondary accent, or with a
monosyllable, or with the root-syllable of a disyllabic<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_31" id="Pg_31" title="31"></a> word. Sievers
looks on these syllables as having in the rhythm of the verse the nature
of a minor arsis (<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Nebenhebung</em>); they rather belong to the class
of syllables standing in thesis but with a slight degree of accent
(<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">tieftonige Senkung</em>).</p>

<p>The two sections of the alliterative line rarely exhibit a strict
symmetry as to the number of the unaccented syllables and their position
with regard to the accented syllables. In the great majority of cases
their similarity consists merely in their having each two accented
syllables, their divergence in other respects being very considerable.
It is to be noted that certain combinations of accented and unaccented
syllables occur with more frequency in one hemistich than in the other,
or are even limited to one of the two hemistichs only.</p>

<p>Besides the ordinary or normal alliterative line with four accents,
there exists in Old English and in other West-Germanic poetry a variety
of the alliterative line called the <em>lengthened line</em> (<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schwellvers</em> or
<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Streckvers</em>). In this line each hemistich has three accented syllables,
the unaccented syllables standing in the same relation to the accented
ones as they do in the normal two-beat hemistich.</p>

<p><a name="section22" id="section22"></a>
§ <b>22. The structure of the hemistich in the normal alliterative
line.</b> The normal hemistich consists of four, seldom of five members<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
(<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Glieder</em>), two of which are strongly accented (arses), the others
unaccented or less strongly accented (theses). Each arsis is formed,
as a rule, of a long accented syllable (<span class="scansion">–́</span>), but the second part of a
compound, and (less frequently) the second syllable with a secondary
accent of a trisyllabic or disyllabic word, is allowed to stand as an
arsis. By resolution a long accented syllable may be replaced by two
short syllables, the first of which is accented. This is denoted by the
symbol <span class="scansion">⏑́×</span>. The less strongly accented members of the hemistich fall
into two classes according as they are unaccented or have the secondary
accent. This division depends ultimately on the logical or etymological
importance of the syllables. Unaccented syllables (marked in Sievers’s
notation by <span class="scansion">×</span>) whether long or short by etymology, are mostly
inflexional endings, formative elements, or proclitic and enclitic words.</p>

<p>Secondarily accented verse-members, mostly monosyllabic and
long (denoted by <span class="scansion">×̀</span>, and occasionally, when short, by <span class="scansion">⏑̀</span>), are
root-syllables in the second part of compounds, long second syllables
of trisyllabic words whose root-syllable is long, and<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_32" id="Pg_32" title="32"></a> other syllables
where in ordinary speech the presence of a secondary accent is
unmistakable. The rhythmical value of these syllables with secondary
accent is not always the same. When they stand in a foot or measure
of two members and are preceded by an accented syllable they count
as simply unaccented, and the foot is practically identical with the
normal type represented by the notation <span class="scansion">–́×</span> (as in the hemistich
<em>wī́sra wórda</em>), but these half-accented syllables may be called
<em>heavy</em> theses, and the feet which contain them may be denoted by the
formula <span class="scansion">–́×̀</span>, as in <em>wí̄sfæ̀st wórdum</em> (<span class="scansion">–́×̀|–́×</span>). A hemistich
like the last is called by Sievers strengthened (<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">gesteigert</em>),
or if it has two heavy unaccented syllables in both feet, doubly
strengthened, as in the section <em>gū́ðrìnc góldwlànc</em> (<span class="scansion">–́×̀|–́×̀</span>).
In these examples the occurrence of a heavy unaccented syllable
is permissible but not necessary; but in feet or measures of three
members they are obligatory, being required as an intermediate degree
between the arsis and thesis, or strongly accented and unaccented
member, as in <em>þégn Hrṓðgā́res</em> (<span class="scansion">–́|–́××̀</span>), or <em>fýrst fórð
gewà̄t</em> (<span class="scansion">–́|–́××̀</span>), or <em>hḗalǣ̀rna mǣ́st</em> (<span class="scansion">–́×̀×|–́</span>).
In these cases Sievers gives the verse-member with this secondary
accent the character of a subordinate arsis, or beat (<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Nebenhebung</em>).
But it is better, in view of the strongly marked two-beat swing of the
hemistich, to look on such members with a secondary accent as having
only the rhythmical value of unaccented syllables, and to call them
<em>theses</em> with a slight accent. The two-beat rhythm of the hemistich
is its main characteristic, for though the two beats are not always
of exactly equal force<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> they are always prominently distinguished
from the unaccented members of the hemistich, the rhythm of which would
be marred by the introduction of an additional beat however slightly
marked.</p>

<p>Cases in which the two chief beats of the hemistich are not of exactly
the same force occur when two accented syllables, either both with
chief accent or one with chief and the other with secondary accent,
stand in immediate juxtaposition, not separated by an unaccented
syllable. The second of these two accented syllables may be a short
syllable with chief accent, instead of a long syllable as is the rule.
But in either case, whether long or short, this second beat following
at once on the first beat is usually uttered with somewhat less force
than the first, as can be seen from examples like <em>gebū́n hǽfdon</em>,
Beow. 117; <em>tō<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_33" id="Pg_33" title="33"></a> hā́m fáran</em>, 121; <em>mid ǣ́rdǽge</em>, 126. The
second beat rarely predominates over the first. The cause of this
variation in the force of the two beats is to be sought in the laws of
the syntactical accent.</p>

<p>In other respects verse-members with a secondary accent obey the same
laws as those with a primary accent. They usually consist of one long
syllable, but if a member which has the arsis immediately precedes, a
short syllable with a secondary accent may be substituted. Resolution
of such verse members is rare, which shows that they are more closely
related to the thesis than to the arsis of the hemistich. One unaccented
syllable is sufficient to form the thesis (<span class="scansion">×</span>), but the thesis may also
have two or more unaccented syllables (<span class="scansion">××,×××..</span>), their number
increasing in proportion to their shortness and the ease with which they
can be pronounced, provided always that no secondary accent intervenes.
All of these unaccented syllables are reckoned together as one thesis,
as against the accented syllable or arsis. The single components of such
a longer thesis may exhibit a certain gradation of force when compared
with one another, but this degree of force must never equal the force
with which the arsis is pronounced, though we sometimes find that,
owing to the varying character of the syntactical or sentence accent,
a monosyllable which in one case stands in the thesis, may in another
connexion bear the secondary or even the primary accent.</p>

<p><a name="section23" id="section23"></a>
§ <b>23.</b> The number of the unaccented syllables of the thesis was
formerly believed to depend entirely on the choice of the individual
poet.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Sievers first put this matter in its right light by the
statistics of the metre.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> He showed that the hemistich of the Old
English alliterative line is similar to the Old Norse four-syllable
verse, and is as a rule of a trochaic rhythm (<span class="scansion">–́×–́×</span>). The proof of
this is that in <cite>Beowulf</cite>, for instance, there are 592 hemistichs of
the type <span class="scansion">–́×|–́×</span> (as <em>hȳ́ran scólde</em>, 10), and that in the same
text there are 238 of the type <span class="scansion">–́××|–́×</span> (as <em>gṓde gewýrcean</em>,
20; <em>hḗold þenden lī́fde</em>, 57), making 830 hemistichs with
trochaic or dactylic rhythm, as against eleven hemistichs of similar
structure but with an unaccented syllable at the beginning, <span class="scansion">×|–́×(×)|–́×</span>, and even four or five of these eleven are of doubtful
correctness. From these figures it seems almost beyond doubt that in
the<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_34" id="Pg_34" title="34"></a> type <span class="scansion">–́×(×)|–́×</span> the licence of letting the hemistich begin
with an unaccented syllable before the first accented syllable was,
generally speaking, avoided. On the other hand, when the first accented
syllable is short with only one unaccented syllable as thesis (<span class="scansion">⏑́×</span>),
we find this initial unaccented syllable to be the rule, as <em>genúmen
hǽfdon</em> Beow. 3167 (<span class="scansion">×|⏑́×|–́×</span>), of which form there are 130
examples, while, as Rieger noticed, <span class="scansion">⏑́×|–́×</span> is rare, as in <em>cýning
mǣ́nan</em> Beow. 3173. It is perhaps still more remarkable that while
the form <span class="scansion">–́××|–́×</span> occurs some 238 times, a verse of the form <span class="scansion">×|⏑́××|–́×</span>
is never found at all. The numerical proportion of the
form <span class="scansion">–́×|–́×</span> (592 cases) to <span class="scansion">–́××|–́×</span> (238 cases) is roughly
5 to 2, and that of <span class="scansion">×|⏑́×|–́×</span> (130 cases) to <span class="scansion">×|⏑́××|–́×</span>
(no cases) is 130 to nothing. The quantity of the second arsis is, as
bearing on the prefixing of unaccented syllables to the hemistich, much
less important than the quantity of the first arsis. Hemistichs of the
type <span class="scansion">–́×|⏑́×</span> occur 34 times, and in 29 cases the last unaccented
syllable is a full word, either a monosyllable or a part of a compound.
The same type, with an initial unaccented syllable <span class="scansion">×|–́×|⏑́×</span> also
occurs 34 times, but then the last syllable is quite unaccented. The
proportion of the form <span class="scansion">–́×|–́×</span> to the form <span class="scansion">×|–́×|–́×</span> is 592
to 11, and that of the form <span class="scansion">–́×|⏑́×</span> to <span class="scansion">×–́×|⏑́×</span> is 34 to 34, a
noticeable difference.</p>

<p>Further, it was formerly supposed that the number of unaccented
syllables following the accented syllable was indifferent. This is not
the case. The form <span class="scansion">–́××|–́×</span> is found 238 times, and the form <span class="scansion">–́×|–́××</span>
only 22 times. Many of the examples of the latter form are
doubtful, but even counting all these the proportion of the two forms
is 11 to 1.</p>

<p>If the two accented syllables are not separated by an unaccented
syllable, that is to say, if the two beats are in immediate
juxtaposition, then either two unaccented syllables must stand after
the second arsis, thus <span class="scansion">–́|–́××</span> (a form that occurs 120 times in
<cite>Beowulf</cite>), or an unaccented syllable must precede the first arsis and
one unaccented syllable must follow the second arsis, thus <span class="scansion">×–́|–́×</span>
(127 times in <cite>Beowulf</cite>), or with the second arsis short <span class="scansion">×–́|⏑́×</span>
(257 times); the form <span class="scansion">–́|–́×</span> does not occur.</p>

<p>From these statistics it results that hemistichs of the form <span class="scansion">–́×|–́×</span> are met with about 17 times to one occurrence of the form <span class="scansion">–́×|⏑́×</span>, and that on the other hand, the form <span class="scansion">×–́|⏑́×</span> is about twice as
frequent as <span class="scansion">×–́|–́×.</span></p>

§ <b>24. The order of the verse-members in the hemistich.</b> Every
hemistich consists of two feet or measures, each containing an accented
syllable. Usually these two feet or measures together contain four
verse members, seldom five. In the hemistich of four members, which
first falls to be considered, the measures may consist of two members
each (2+2), or one may contain one member and the other three (1+3 or
3+1). A measure of one member has a single accented syllable only (<span class="scansion">–́</span>);
a measure of two members has an accented and an unaccented syllable,
which may stand either in the order <span class="scansion">–́×</span> or <span class="scansion">×–́</span>; a measure of three
members has one accented and two unaccented syllables, one of which has
a secondary accent, and the order may be either <span class="scansion">–́×̀×</span> or <span class="scansion">–́××̀</span>.
Measures of two members may be grouped in three different ways so as to
form a hemistich: i. <span class="scansion">–́×|–́×</span> (descending rhythm); ii. <span class="scansion">×–́|×–́</span>
(ascending); iii. <span class="scansion">×–́|–́×</span> (ascending-descending)<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>; i. and ii.
are symmetrical, iii. is unsymmetrical, but as the number of members in
the feet of these three types (2+2 members) is the same, we may call
them, as Sievers does, types with equal feet (<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">gleichfüssige Typen</em>),
while the others (1+3 members or 3+1 members) may be called types with
unequal feet, or measures.</p>

<p>The normal hemistich, then, which consists of four verse-members, will
fall, according to the relative position of these measures or feet, into
the following five chief types:</p>

<p class="pad5"><b>a.</b> Types with equal feet (2+2 members)</p>

<table summary="chief types">
<tr><td>1.</td><td>A.</td><td><span class="scansion">–́×|–́×</span> double descending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.</td><td>B.</td><td><span class="scansion">×–́|×–́</span> double ascending.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3.</td><td>C.</td><td><span class="scansion">×–́|–́×</span> ascending-descending.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="quote"><b>b.</b> Types with unequal feet</p>

<table summary="chief types unequal feet">
<tr><td>4.</td><td>D.</td><td class="large">{</td><td><span class="scansion">–́|–́×̀×</span><br />
                                                     <span class="scansion">–́|–́××̀</span></td><td class="large">}</td><td>(1+3 members).</td></tr>
<tr><td>5.</td><td>E.</td><td class="large">{</td><td><span class="scansion">–́×̀×|–́</span><br />
                                                     <span class="scansion">–́××̀|–́</span></td><td class="large">}</td><td>(3+1 members).</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Theoretically type E might be looked on as a type with equal feet, if
divided thus, <span class="scansion">–́×|×–́</span>, but by far the greatest number of instances
of this type show at the beginning of the hemistich one trisyllabic
word which forbids such a division of feet, as<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_36" id="Pg_36" title="36"></a> <em>wéorðmỳndum þā́h</em>,
Beow. 8.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Types like <span class="scansion">××–́–</span> and <span class="scansion">×̀×–́–́</span>, which we might
expect to find, do not occur in Old English poetry. In addition to
these ordinary four-membered hemistichs there are others lengthened
by the addition of one syllable, which may be unaccented, or have the
secondary accent. These extended forms (<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">erweiterte Formen</em>)<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> may
be composed either of 2+3 members or of 3+2 members. These extended
hemistichs must be carefully distinguished from the hemistichs which
have one or more unaccented syllables <em>before</em> the first accented
syllable, in types A, D, and E; such a prefix of one or more syllables
is called an <em>anacrusis</em> (Auftakt)<span class="locked">.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>The simple five types of the hemistich admit of variation: i. by
extension (as above); ii. by resolution (<span class="scansion">⏑́×</span> for <span class="scansion">–́</span>) and shortening
of the long accented syllable (<span class="scansion">⏑́</span>); iii. by strengthening of thesis
by means of a secondary accent (<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Steigerung</em>); iv. by increase in
the number of unaccented syllables forming the thesis; also (less
frequently) v. by variation in the position of the alliteration, and
vi. by the admission of anacruses; the varieties produced by the
last-mentioned means are not sub-types but parallel forms to those
without anacruses.</p>

<p>In describing and analysing the different combinations which arise
out of these means of variation, and especially the peculiar forms of
the sub-types, the arrangement and nomenclature of Sievers will be
<span class="locked">followed.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></span></p>


<h4>Analysis of the verse types.</h4>

<h5>I. <em>Hemistichs of four members.</em></h5>

<p><a name="section25" id="section25"></a>
§ <b>25. Type A</b> has three sub-types, <span class="gesperrt">A1</span>, <span class="gesperrt">A2</span>, <span class="gesperrt">A3</span>.</p>

<p><b>The sub-type <span class="gesperrt">A1</span></b> (<span class="scansion">–́×|–́×</span>) is the normal form with alliteration
of the first arsis in each hemistich, or with alliteration of both
arses in the first hemistich and one in the second, and with syllables
in the thesis which are unaccented according to the usual practice
of the language; examples are, <em>þḗodnes<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_37" id="Pg_37" title="37"></a> þêgnas</em> An. 3, <em>hȳ́ran
scólde</em> Beow. 106, <em>gómban gýldan</em> Beow. 11. This is the commonest of
all the types; it occurs in Beowulf, according to Sievers, 471 times
in the first and 575 times in the second hemistich, and with the like
frequency in the other poems.</p>

<p>The simplest modification of this type arises from the resolution of
one or two long accented syllables. Examples of resolution of the first
arsis are very numerous, <em>cýninga wúldor</em> El. 5, <em>scéaðena þrḗatum</em>
Beow. 4, <em>séofon niht swúncon</em> Beow. 517,<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> <em>níðer gewī́teð</em> Beow.
1361. Examples of the resolution of the second arsis are less numerous,
as <em>wúldor cýninge</em> El. 291, <em>éllen frémedon</em> Beow. 3, <em>Scýldes
éaferan</em> Beow. 19, <em>óft gefrémede</em> Beow. 165; resolution of both in the
same hemistich is rare, but is found, as <em>gúmena géogoðe</em> An. 1617,
<em>mǽgenes Déniga</em> Beow. 155, <em>gúmum ætgǽdere</em> Beow. 1321.</p>

<p>The chief type is further modified by making the thesis after the first
arsis disyllabic (rarely trisyllabic); the formula is then <span class="scansion">–́××|–×</span>.
This modification is frequent, as <em>ríhta gehwýlces</em> El. 910, <em>gṓde
gewýrcean</em> Beow. 20, <em>swéordum āswébban</em> An. 72, <em>súnnan ond
mṓnan</em> Beow. 94, <em>fṓlce tō frṓfre</em> Beow. 14, <em>wḗox under
wólcnum</em> Beow. 8.</p>

<p>Resolution of the arsis may be combined with this disyllabic thesis, as
(in the first arsis) <em>wérum on þām wónge</em> An. 22, <em>éotenas ond ýlfe</em>
Beow. 112, or (in the second arsis) <em>hā́lig of héofenum</em> An. 89,
<em>hélpe gefrémede</em> Beow. 551, or (in both) <em>dúguðe ond géoguðe</em> Beow.
160, <em>hǽleð under héofenum</em> Beow. 52.</p>

<p>The first thesis rarely exceeds two syllables; a thesis of three
syllables is occasionally found, as <em>sǽgde se þe cū́ðe</em> Beow. 90,
<em>hwī́lum hie gehḗton</em> Beow. 175, and this can be combined with
resolution of the first arsis, as <em>swéotulra ond gesȳ́nra</em> An. 565,
<em>bítere ond gebólgne</em> Beow. 1431; or with resolution of the second
arsis, as <em>ū́tan ymbe ǽðelne</em> An. 873, <em>wī́ge under wǽtere</em>
Beow. 1657; or with resolution of both, as <em>réceda under róderum</em> Beow.
310. Examples of thesis of four syllables are (in the first thesis)
<em>séalde þām þe hē wólde</em> Beow. 3056, <em>sécge ic þē tō
sṓðe</em> Beow. 591. A thesis with five syllables is still less common,
as <em>lǣ́ddon hine þā of lýfte</em> Gū. 398, <em>stṓpon þā tō
þǣre stṓwe</em> El. 716.</p>

<p>The cases in which the second thesis has two syllables are rare and to
some extent doubtful, as <em>wúndor scḗawian</em> Beow. 841 and <span class="locked">3033.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></span></p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_38" id="Pg_38" title="38"></a></p>

<p>The anacrusis before the type <span class="scansion">–́×(×)|–́×</span> is also of rare
occurrence: examples are <em>swā sǣ́ bebū́geð</em> Beow. 1224, or,
with resolution of the first arsis, <em>swā wǽter bebū́geð</em>
Beow. 93. Most of the instances occur in the first hemistich; in
this position the anacrusis may be polysyllabic (extending sometimes
to four syllables), sometimes with resolution of the arsis, or with
polysyllabic thesis. Examples: <em>forcṓm æt cámpe</em> An. 1327, <em>gewāt
æt wī́ge</em> Beow. 2630; with resolution, <em>ābóden in búrgum</em> An.
78; <em>genéred wið nī́ðe</em> Beow. 828; disyllabic anacrusis <em>ic wæs
éndesǣ́ta</em> Beow. 241; with resolution, <em>þǣr wæs hǽleða
hléahtor</em> Beow. 612; trisyllabic anacrusis, <em>oððe him Óngenþḗowes</em>
Beow. 2475; four-syllable anacrusis, <em>þæt we him þā gū́ðgeatwa</em>
Beow. 2637; monosyllabic anacrusis with disyllabic thesis, as <em>in
mǣ́gðe gehwǣ́re</em> Beow. 25, <em>āblénded in búrgum</em> An. 78;
disyllabic anacrusis with disyllabic thesis, <em>ge æt hā́m ge on
hérge</em> Beow. 1249; trisyllabic anacrusis with disyllabic thesis, <em>þū
scealt þā fṓre gefḗran</em> An. 216; monosyllabic anacrusis
with trisyllabic thesis, <em>gemúnde þā sē gṓda</em> Beow. 759;
monosyllabic anacrusis with resolution of first arsis and trisyllabic
thesis, <em>ne mágon hie ond ne mṓton</em> An. 1217; with resolution of
second arsis, <em>gewā́t him þā tō wároðe</em> Beow. 234; disyllabic
anacrusis, <em>ne geféah he þǣre fǣ́hðe</em> Beow. 109; combined with
thesis of four syllables, <em>ofslṓh þā æt þǣre sǽcce</em> Beow.
1666.</p>

<p><b>The sub-type <span class="gesperrt">A2</span></b> is type A with strengthened thesis (i.e. a thesis
with secondary accent) and with alliteration on the first arsis only.
This sub-type has several varieties:</p>

<p>(i) <span class="gesperrt">A2<em>a</em></span>, with the <em>first</em> thesis strengthened (<span class="scansion">–́×̀|–́×</span>); frequent
in the second hemistich. The second arsis may be either long or short
(<span class="scansion">–́×̀|–́×,</span> or <span class="scansion">–́×̀|⏑́×</span>). We denote <span class="scansion">–́×̀|–́×</span> by <span class="gesperrt">A2<em>al</em></span> and
<span class="scansion">–́×̀|⏑́×</span> by <span class="gesperrt">A2a</span>sh, or, for brevity, <span class="gesperrt">A2<em>l</em></span>, <span class="gesperrt">A2</span><em>sh</em>. Examples
of <span class="gesperrt">A2<em>l</em></span> are, <em>gódspèl ǣ́rest</em> An. 12, <em>wī́sfæ̀st wórdum</em> Beow.
626, <em>hríngnèt bǣ́ron</em> Beow. 1890; with resolution of the first
arsis, <em>médusèld bū́an</em> Beow. 3066; with resolution of the second
arsis, <em>gā́rsècg hlýnede</em> An. 238, <em>hórdbùrh hǽleða</em> Beow. 467;
with resolution of both, <em>fréoðobùrh fǽgere</em> Beow. 522; with
resolution of the strengthened thesis, <em>súndwùdu sṓhte</em> Beow. 208;
resolution of the first arsis and thesis, <em>mǽgenwùdu múndum</em> Beow.
236; resolution of the first thesis and the second arsis, <em>gū́ðsèaro
gúmena</em> Beow. 328.</p>

<p>Examples of <span class="gesperrt">A2</span><em>sh</em> are numerous, as <em>wǣ́rfæ̀st cýning</em> An. 416,
<em>gū́ðrìnc mónig</em> Beow. 839, <em>þrḗanȳ̀d þólað</em> Beow. 284; it
is exceptional to find the second arsis short when the thesis which
precedes has no secondary accent, as <em>Hrḗðel cýning</em> Beow.<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_39" id="Pg_39" title="39"></a> 2436,
<em>Hrúnting náma</em> Beow. 1458, <em>ǽðeling bóren</em> Beow. 2431; with
resolution of the first arsis, <em>séaronèt séowað</em> An. 64, <em>snótor cèorl
mónig</em> Beow. 909, <em>sígerṑf cyning</em> Beow. 619, <em>mágodrìht micel</em> Beow.
67, &amp;c. Most of the hemistichs which fall under this head have double
alliteration.</p>

<p>(ii) <span class="gesperrt">A2</span><em>b</em>, with the <em>second</em> thesis strengthened (<span class="scansion">–́×|–́×̀</span>).
Most of the cases of this type occur in the first hemistich; when they
occur in the second hemistich the measure <span class="scansion">–́×̀ </span> is usually a proper
name, not a real compound. Examples: <em>Gréndles gū́ðcræ̀ft</em> Beow. 127,
<em>lḗofa Bḗowùlf</em> Beow. 855; with resolution of the first arsis,
<em>gámol ond gūðrḕow</em> Beow. 58; with resolution of the second arsis,
<em>béorna béaducræ̀ft</em> An. 219; with resolution of both, <em>séfa swā
séarogrìm</em> Beow. 595; with resolution of the strengthened thesis, <em>lónd
ond lḗodbỳrig</em> Beow. 2472; with resolution of both the second arsis
and thesis <em>mǣ́g ond mágoþègn</em> Beow. <span class="locked">408.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>This type may still further be varied by a first thesis of two or more
syllables, <em>ū́t on þæt ī́glànd</em> An. 15, <em>fólc oððe frḗobùrh</em>
Beow. 694, <em>réste hine þā rū́mhèort</em> Beow. 1800; by resolution of
the first arsis, <em>glídon ofer gārsècg</em> Beow. 515, of the second,
<em>lā́d ofer lágustrḕam</em> An. 423, <em>sýmbel on sélefùl</em> Beow. 620; by
resolution of the thesis with secondary accent, <em>éahtodon éorlscìpe</em>
Beow. 3173; the anacrusis is rarely found, as <em>gesā́won séledrḕam</em>
Beow. 2253, and double alliteration (in the first hemistich) is the
rule in this form of type A.</p>

<p>(iii) <span class="gesperrt">A2</span><em>ab</em>, with both theses strengthened <span class="scansion">–́×̀|–́×̀</span>,
<em>bā́nhū̀s blṓdfā̀g</em> An. 1407, <em>gū́ðrìnc góldwlànc</em>
Beow. 1882, <em>ǣ́nlī̀c ánsȳ̀n</em> Beow. 251; with resolution of
first arsis, <em>wlítesḕon wrǽtlī̀c</em> Beow. 1651, and of the
second arsis, <em>glḗawmṑd góde lḕof</em> An. 1581, <em>gū̀ðswèord
géatolī̀c</em> Beow. 2155, and of both first and second arsis,
<em>héorowèarh hételī̀c</em> Beow. 1268; with resolution of the first
(strengthened) thesis, <em>nȳ́dwràcu nī́ðgrìm</em> Beow. 193; with
resolution of both the first arsis and the first thesis, <em>býrelàde
brȳ́d gèong</em> Gū. 842; with resolution of the second strengthened
thesis, <em>égeslī̀c éorðdràca</em> Beow. 2826; with resolution of the first
and second thesis, <em>fýrdsèaru fūslìcu</em> Beow. 232. This form of the
type has also as a rule double alliteration.</p>

<p><b>The sub-type <span class="gesperrt">A3</span></b> is type A with alliteration on the second arsis only
and is limited almost entirely to the first hemistich. A strengthened
thesis occurs only after the second arsis; this sub-type might
therefore be designated <span class="gesperrt">A3<em>b</em></span>.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_40" id="Pg_40" title="40"></a></p>

<p>Verses falling under this head, with their alliteration always on the
last syllable but one, or (in the case of resolution) on the last
syllable but two, are distinguished by the frequent occurrence of
polysyllabic theses extending to five syllables, in marked contrast
to types <span class="gesperrt">A1</span> and <span class="gesperrt">A2</span> where theses of one or two syllables are the
rule, longer theses the exception. In <span class="gesperrt">A3</span>, however, shorter theses
are met with along with the usual resolutions: a monosyllabic thesis
in <em>hwǣ́r se <b>þ</b>ḗoden</em> El. 563, <em>ḗow hēt sécgan</em> Beow.
391; with resolution of first arsis, <em>wúton nū éfstan</em> Beow. 3102;
with resolution of the second arsis, <em>þús me <b>f</b>ǽder mīn</em> El.
528, <em>íc þæt <b>h</b>ógode</em> Beow. 633; with disyllabic thesis, <em>hḗht
þā on <b>ú</b>htan</em> El. 105, <em>hǽfde se <b>g</b>ṓda</em> Beow. 205; with
resolution of the first arsis, <em>þánon he ge<b>s</b>ṓhte</em> Beow. 463;
with resolution of the second arsis, <em>wéarð him on <b>H</b>éorote</em> Beow.
1331; with strengthened second thesis, <em>éart þū sē <b>B</b>ḗowùlf</em>
Beow. 506; with trisyllabic thesis, <em>gíf þē þæt ge<b>l</b>ímpe</em> El. 441,
<em>fúndon þā on <b>s</b>ánde</em> Beow. 3034; with resolution of the first
arsis, <em>hwǽðere mē ge<b>s</b>ǣ́lde</em> Beow. 574, of the second
arsis, <em>sýððan ic for <b>d</b>úgeðum</em> Beow. 2502; with strengthened second
thesis, <em>nṓ hē þone <b>g</b>ífstṑl</em> Beow. 168; with thesis of
four syllables, <em>swýlce hī mē ge<b>b</b>léndon</em> Cri. 1438, <em>hábbað
wē tō þǣm <b>m</b>ǣ́ran</em> Beow. 270; with resolution of the
first arsis, <em>útan ūs tō þǣre <b>h</b>ȳ́ðe</em> Cri. 865; with
resolution of the first and second arsis, <em>þóne þe him on <b>s</b>wéofote</em>
Beow. 2296; with strengthened second thesis, <em>nṓ þȳ ǣr þone
<b>h</b>éaðorìnc</em> Beow. 2466; with thesis of five syllables, <em>sýððan hē
hine to <b>g</b>ū̀ðe</em> Beow. 1473; with thesis of six syllables, <em>hȳ́rde
ic þæt hē þone <b>h</b>éalsbḕah</em> Beow. 2173. These forms are also
varied by monosyllabic anacrusis combined with monosyllabic thesis,
<em>þe ḗow of <b>w</b>érgðe</em> El. 295, <em>þæt híne on <b>ý</b>lde</em> Beow. 22; with
strengthened second thesis, <em>þæt híne sēo <b>b</b>rímwỳlf</em> Beow. 1600;
with disyllabic thesis, <em>ne þéarft þū swā <b>s</b>wī́ðe</em> El. 940,
<em>gesprǽc þā sē <b>g</b>ṓda</em> Beow. 676; the same with resolution
of the first arsis, <em>gewítan him þā <b>g</b>óngan</em> Cri. 533; disyllabic
anacrusis and disyllabic thesis, <em>ne gefrǽgn ic þā <b>m</b>ǣ́gðe</em>
Beow. 1012; with resolution of the second arsis, <em>geséah hē in
<b>r</b>écede</em> Beow. 728; with strengthened second thesis, <em>ge swýlce sēo
<b>h</b>érepà̄d</em> Beow. 2259; monosyllabic anacrusis with trisyllabic
thesis, <em>on hwýlcum þāra <b>b</b>ḗama</em> El. 851; with four-syllable
thesis, <em>gewī́teð þonne on <b>s</b>ealman</em> Beow. 2461; with resolution of
the first arsis, <em>ne mā́gon hī þonne ge<b>h</b>ȳ́nan</em> Cri. 1525; with
resolution of the second arsis, <em>gesā́won þā æfter <b>w</b>ǽtere</em>
Beow. 1426. The last measure may be shortened exceptionally to <span class="scansion">⏑́×</span>, as
<em>wǽs mīn <b>f</b>ǽder</em> Beow. 262.</p>

<p>On the whole type A seems to occur more frequently in the<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_41" id="Pg_41" title="41"></a> first than in
the second hemistich; in Beowulf out of the 6366 hemistichs of which the
poem consists, 2819 fall under this type, and of these 1701 are first
and 1118 second <span class="locked">hemistichs.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="section26" id="section26"></a>
§ <b>26. The chief type B</b>, <span class="scansion">×–́|×–́</span>, has apart from resolutions
only one form. But as the second thesis may consist of either one or
two syllables, we may distinguish between two sub-types, <span class="gesperrt">B1</span> (with
monosyllabic second thesis) and <span class="gesperrt">B2</span> (with disyllabic second thesis). The
commonest variation of the type occurs in the first thesis, which may
be polysyllabic.</p>

<p>(i) The simplest form, sub-type <span class="gesperrt">B1</span>, <span class="scansion">×–́|×–́</span>, is not very common;
according to Sievers there are only 59 instances in the whole of
Beowulf, as <em>ond Hā́lga tíl</em> Beow. 61, <em>þām hā́lig gód</em> An.
14; with resolution of the first arsis <em>in séle þām hḗan</em> Beow.
714, and of the second arsis, <em>þurh rū̀mne séfan</em> Beow. 278, and of
both, <em>ǣr súmeres cýme</em> El. 1228. Hemistichs of this type, on the
other hand, with a disyllabic first thesis are not uncommon, <em>syððan
fúrðum wḗox</em> Beow. 914, <em>him pā Scýld gewā́t</em> Beow. 26; with
resolution of the first arsis, <em>under Héorotes hrṓf</em> Beow. 403; with
resolution of the second, <em>þæt sēo céaster híder</em> An. 207, and of
both, <em>æfter hǽleða hrýre</em> Beow. 2053; a trisyllabic first thesis
is also common, <em>þēah þe hē ā́tres drýnc</em> An. 53, <em>oð þæt him
éft onwṓc</em> Beow. 56, <em>sē þe on hánda bǽr</em> Beow. 495; with
resolution of the first arsis, <em>forðan hīe mǽgenes crǽft</em>
Beow. 418; of the second arsis, <em>ond hū þȳ þríddan dǽge</em> El.
185; of both, <em>þæt hē þā géoguðe wíle</em> Beow. 1182; with first
thesis of four syllables, <em>ne hȳrde ic sī́ð ne ǣ́r</em> El. 240,
<em>swylce hīe æt Fínnes hā́m</em> Beow. 1157; with first thesis of five
syllables (rare) <em>siððan hē hire fólmum hrā́n</em> Beow. 723, and with
resolution of second arsis <em>þonne hȳ him þurh mī́nne nóman</em> Cri.
1351.</p>

<p>(ii) The sub-type <span class="gesperrt">B2</span>, or B with disyllabic second thesis, is rarely
found when the first thesis has only one syllable, <em>þe drýhtnes
bibṓd</em> Cri. 1159, <em>þū wá̄st gif hit is</em> Beow. 272, <em>þām
wī́fe þā wórd</em> Beow. 640; with resolution of the first arsis,
<em>þurh dároða gedrép</em> An. 1446, and of the second, <em>þurh níhta genípu</em>
Gū. 321; it is commoner with a disyllabic first thesis, <em>þā of
wéalle geséah</em> Beow. 229, <em>hē þæs frṓfre gebā́d</em> Beow. 76; with
resolution of the first arsis, <em>mid his hǽleða gedríht</em> Beow. 663,
<em>ofer wároða gewéorp</em> An. 306; with trisyllabic first thesis, <em>þonne
hē ǣ́r oððe sī́ð</em> El. 74, <em>wes þū ūs lā́rena gṓd</em>
Beow. 269; with resolution of the first arsis, <em>þēah hē þǣr
mónige geséah</em> Beow. 1614, and of the second arsis, <em>þæt nǣfre
Gréndel swā féla</em> Beow. 592; with first thesis of<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_42" id="Pg_42" title="42"></a> four and five
syllables, <em>hwæðre hē in brḗostum þā gít</em> An. 51, <em>þæs be hire
sē wílla gelámp</em> Beow. 627.</p>

<p>Verses with trisyllabic second thesis are extremely rare and
doubtful.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> It should be noticed that, in this second type too, the
thesis seldom consists of a second part of a compound, as <em>hine fýrwìt
brǽc</em> Beow. 232, the exceptions are proper names, as <em>nū ic
Bḗowùlf þéc</em> Beow. 947, <em>ne wearð Héremṑd swā́</em> Beow. 1710.</p>

<p>Type B, according to Sievers, occurs 1014 times in Beowulf,
of which 293 are in the first hemistich and 721 in the second.</p>

<p><a name="section27" id="section27"></a>
§ <b>27. The Type C</b> has three sub-types: (i) <span class="gesperrt">C1</span>, the normal type
<span class="scansion">×–́|–́×</span>, without resolution, as <em>oft Scýld Scḗfing</em> Beow. 4,
<em>gebū̀n hǽfdon</em> 117. Here too the first thesis may consist of two,
three, four, or five syllables, <em>þæt hīe ǣ́ghwýlcne</em> An. 26,
<em>þone gód sénde</em> Beow. 13, <em>ofer hrónrā́de</em> Beow. 10, <em>ǣr hē

<em>oð þæt hine sémnínga</em> An. 821, <em>þāra þe hē him míd hǽfde</em>
Beow. 1625, <em>swylce hīe ofer sǣ́e cṓmon</em>, An. 247. (ii) C 2
is the normal type C with resolution of the first arsis, and is of
such frequent occurrence that it may be looked on as a special type,
<em>on hérefélda</em> An. 10, <em>forscrífen hǽfde</em> Beow. 106, <em>in wórold
wṓcun</em> Beow. 60; a less common form is that with resolution of the
first and second arsis, <em>tō brímes fároðe</em> Beow. 28, <em>swā féla
fýrena</em> Beow. 164; sometimes with resolution of the second arsis only,
<em>tō sǣ́es fároðe</em> An. 236 and 1660, <em>for frḗan égesan</em> An.
457, but not in Beowulf. The first thesis may have two, three, or four
syllables, <em>þā wið góde wúnnon</em> Beow. 113, <em>ofer lágustrǣ́te</em>;
with two resolutions, <em>ic þæs wíne Déniga</em> Beow. 350, <em>hū sē
mága frémede</em> An. 639, <em>þæt him his wínemā́gas</em> Beow. 65, <em>ne hīe
hūru wínedríhten</em> Beow. 863. (iii) <span class="gesperrt">C3</span> is type C with short second
arsis, <span class="scansion">×–́|⏑́×</span>, and is pretty common, <em>in gḗardágum</em> Beow.
1, <em>of fḗorwégum</em> Beow. 37; the first thesis may have from two
to five syllables, <em>þæt wæs gṓd cýning</em> Beow. 11, <em>þæt hīe in
bḗorséle</em> Beow. 482, <em>sē þe hine dḗað nímeð</em> Beow. 441, <em>ne
meaht þū þæs sī́ðfǽtes</em> An. 211, <em>þonne hē on þæt sínc
stárað</em> Beow. 1486. Resolution seems to be avoided, though it occurs
here and there, <em>of hlíðes nósan</em> Beow. 1892, <em>on þǣm méðelstéde</em>
Beow. 1083. Thesis with secondary accent is not found. The number of
hemistichs of type C in Beowulf is, according to Sievers, 564</p>

<p><a name="section28" id="section28"></a>
§ <b>28. The type D</b> always ends with a disyllabic thesis, of which
the first is generally the second syllable of a compound<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_43" id="Pg_43" title="43"></a> and has the
secondary accent. There are four sub-types. (i) <span class="gesperrt">D1</span> is the normal form,
<span class="scansion">–́|–́×̀×</span>, as <em>hélm ǽlwìhta</em> An. 118, <em>fḗond máncỳnnes</em>
Beow. 164, <em>wī́gwéorðùnga</em> Beow. 176, <em>wéard Scýldìnga</em> Beow. 95,
<em>lándbúèndum</em> Beow. 95, <em>hríng gýldènne</em>, Beow. 2810, <em>hóf mṓdìgra</em>
Beow. 312, <em>frḗan ū̀sèrne</em> Beow. 3003. The chief variations arise
from resolution of the first arsis, <em>cýning ǽlmìhtig</em> El. 145,
<em>fǽder álwàlda</em> Beow. 316, <em>mérelī́ðènde</em> Beow. 255, <em>flótan
ḗowèrne</em> Beow. 294, <em>cýning ǣ́nìgne</em> Beow. 1851, or of the
second arsis, <em>hḗan hýgegḕomor</em> An. 1089, <em>mǣ́g Hígelà̄ces</em>
Beow. 738 and 759; resolution of first and second arsis, <em>hláden
hérewǣ̀dum</em> Beow. 1898, <em>néfan Hérerī̀ces</em> Beow. 2207. Hemistichs
like <em>wiht unhǣlo</em> Beow. 120, which have compounds with <em>un</em>, may
be read <em>wíht únhǽlo</em> according to type <span class="gesperrt">D2</span>, or <em>wíht unhǣ́lo</em>
according to type A, <span class="scansion">–́×|–́×</span> (Sievers, <cite>Paul-Braune’s Beiträge</cite>,
x. 251, and Kluge in <cite>Paul’s Grundriss</cite>, i<sup>2</sup>, p. 1051). (ii) <span class="gesperrt">D2</span> is
the same form, but with the thesis short and with secondary accent,
<span class="scansion">–́|–́⏑̀×</span> <em>béorht blǽdgìfa</em> An. 84, <em>lḗof lándfrùma</em> Beow.
31, <em>strḗam ū́t þònan</em> Beow. 2546, <em>rǣ́d éahtèdon</em> Beow. 172;
with resolution of the first arsis, <em>mǽgen sámnòde</em> El. 55, <em>mága
Héalfdènes</em> Beow. 189; with resolution of the second arsis, <em>hórd
ópenìan</em> Beow. 3057, the only example. (iii) D 3 is the normal type,
but with short second arsis (rare), <span class="scansion">–́|⏑́×̀×</span>, <em>éorðcýnìnga</em> El.
1174; with resolution of the first arsis, <em>rádorcýnìnges</em> El. 624.
(iv) D 4 has the form <span class="scansion">–́|–́××̀</span>, and is closely allied to the type
E (<span class="scansion">–́×̀×|–́</span>), as it has the secondary accent on the last syllable
of the thesis (Sievers, <cite>Paul-Braune’s Beiträge</cite>, x. 256), <em>brḗost
ínnanwèard</em> An. 649, <em>hólm ū̀p ætbæ̀r</em> Beow. 519, <em>fýrst fórð

gū̀ðe fràm</em> An. 234, <em>flóta fā́mighèals</em> Beow. 218, <em>súnu dḗað

lṑod</em> 341, and of both first and second arsis, <em>wlítig wéoruda
hḕap</em> An. 872; and resolution of the last thesis with secondary
accent, <em>wṓp úp āhàfen</em> Beow. 128, <em>wúnað wíntra fèla</em> Ph. 580.
Certain hemistichs which may belong to this sub-type admit of an
alternative accentuation, and may belong to the following type; for
example, <em>scop hwlum sang</em> Beow. 496 may be read <span class="scansion">–́|–́××̀</span>, or as E
<span class="scansion">–́×̀×|–́</span>, so <em>werod eall ārās</em> Beow. 652.</p>

<p><a name="section29" id="section29"></a>
§ <b>29. The type E</b> has two sub-types, distinguished by the position of
the syllable bearing the secondary accent; this syllable is generally
the second syllable of a compound or the heavy middle syllable of a
trisyllabic word with a long root-syllable.</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt">E1</span> has the form <span class="scansion">–́×̀×|–́</span>, the syllable with secondary<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_44" id="Pg_44" title="44"></a> accent
standing first in the thesis, <em>mṓdsòrge wǽg</em> El. 61, <em>wéorðmỳndum

<em>dúguð èall ārā́s</em> Beow. 1791; resolution of the second arsis
is rare, <em>tī́rḕadge hǽleð</em> An. 2 (the MS. reading <em>ēadige</em>
must be corrected to <em>ēadge</em>, see Sievers, <cite>Beiträge</cite>, x. 459 on
these middle vowels after long root-syllable), <em>hélþègnes héte</em> Beow.
142; resolution of both is rare, <em>sélewèard āséted</em> Beow. 668,
<em>wínedrỳhten frǽgen</em> An. 921; resolution of the accented thesis,
<em>glḗdègesa grím</em> Beow. 2651.</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt">E2</span> has the last syllable of the thesis with secondary accent, and

<h5>II. <em>Hemistichs of five members.</em></h5>

<p><a name="section30" id="section30"></a>
§ <b>30.</b> Hemistichs of five members (extended) occur much more rarely
than the normal types of four members. The extended types are denoted by
the letters A*, B*, C*, &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>Type A*</b> has two sub-types distinguished by the position of the
syllable with the secondary accent.</p>

<p>(i) A*1, <span class="scansion">–́×̀×|–́×</span> occurs chiefly in the first hemistich,
<em>gódbèarn on gálgan</em> El. 719; with resolution of first arsis,
<em>géolorànd tō gū́ðe</em> Beow. 438; with thesis of two unaccented
syllables following on the secondary accent, <em>glǽdmṑd on gesíhðe</em>
Cri. 911, <em>fǽstrǽdne geþṓht</em> Beow. 611; with final thesis
strengthened by secondary accent, <em>gā́stlī̀cne góddrḕam</em> Gū.
602, <em>gámolfèax ond gū́ðrṑf</em> Beow. 609.</p>

<p>(ii) A*2 <span class="scansion">–́××̀|–́×</span> may possibly occur in <em>mā́ððumfæ̀t
mǣ́re</em> Beow. 2405, <em>wúldorlḕan wéorca</em> Cri. 1080; with resolution
of the thesis with secondary accent, <em>mórðorbèalo mága</em> Beow. 1079.
Possibly, however, the syllables <em>um</em> in <em>māððum</em> and <em>or</em> in
<em>wuldor</em> and <em>morðor</em> are to be written <em>m</em> and <em>r</em>, so that the
scansion of the hemistich would be <span class="gesperrt">A2</span> <span class="scansion">–́–̀|–́×</span> and <span class="scansion">–́⏑̀͜×|–́×</span>
<span class="locked">.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Type B*</b> <span class="scansion">×̀×–́|×–́</span> does not seem to occur in O.E. poetry, though
it does in Old Norse.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_45" id="Pg_45" title="45"></a></p>

<p><b>Type C*</b> in the forms <span class="scansion">×̀×–́|–́×,×̀×⏑́×|–́×,××–́|⏑́×</span>
are also not found in O.E.</p>

<p><b>Type D*</b> on the other hand does occur, but almost exclusively in
the first hemistich. It has three sub-types: (i) D*1 <span class="scansion">–́×|–́××</span>,
<em>sī́de sǣ́næ̀ssas</em> Beow. 223, <em>áldres órwḕna</em> Beow. 1002;
with resolution of the first arsis, <em>ǽðeling ā́nhȳ̀dig</em>
Beow. 2668; more commonly with resolution of the second arsis,
<em>mǣ́ton mérestræ̀ta</em> Beow. 514; with resolution of both, <em>lócene
léoðosỳrcan</em> Beow. 1506. (ii) D*2 <span class="scansion">–́×|–́⏑̀×,</span> <em>mǣ́re

second arsis, <em>mṓdges mérefàran</em> Beow. 502, <em>Bḗowulf máðelòde</em>
Beow. 505, &amp;c. (iii) D*3 <span class="scansion">–́×|⏑́×̀×</span> is not found.
(iv) D*4 <span class="scansion">–́×|–́××̀</span> is rare, <em>grḗtte Gḗata lḕod</em> Beow. 625, <em>þrȳ́ðlīc

éllorsī̀ð</em> Beow. 2452; with resolution of the second, <em>ȳ́ðde
éotena cỳn</em> Beow. 421; with resolution of the secondarily accented
syllable, <em>wī́n of wúndorfàtum</em> Beow. 1163; this type is varied
by anacrusis, <em>ongínneð gḗomormṑd</em> Beow. 2045, and by anacrusis
together with disyllabic thesis in the second foot, <em>oferswám þā
síoleða bigòng</em> Beow. 2368.</p>

<p><b>Type E*</b> does not occur in O.E. <span class="locked">poetry.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="section31" id="section31"></a>
§ <b>31.</b> To assign the different hemistichs of a poem to these various
types we have to follow as a regulating principle the natural word
accent and syntactical accent of each sentence. In some cases the
similarity or relation with one another of the types renders it a
matter of difficulty to determine exactly to what particular type a
hemistich may belong. Systematic investigations as to the principles
which govern the combinations of the five types in pairs to form the
long line have not yet been made. From such observations as have
been made it would appear that by preference hemistichs of different
rhythmical structure (ascending and descending) were combined with
a view to avoid a monotonous likeness between the two halves of the
verse.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_46" id="Pg_46" title="46"></a></p>

<p><a name="section32" id="section32"></a>
§ <b>32.</b> The combination of two hemistichs so as to form a long line
is effected by means of alliteration, one at least of the two fully
accented syllables being the bearer of an alliterative sound. In no
case is an unaccented syllable or even a syllable with a secondary
accent allowed to take part in the alliteration. This fact, that
secondarily accented syllables are debarred from alliterating, is
another proof that it is better to look on them as belonging to the
thesis rather than to the arsis of the verse.</p>


<h4>The Principles of Alliteration.</h4>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_47" id="Pg_47" title="47"></a></p>

<p><a name="section33" id="section33"></a>
§ <b>33. Quality of the Alliteration.</b> It is an all but invariable
rule that the correspondence of sounds must be exact and not merely
approximate. A <em>g</em> must alliterate to a <em>g</em>, not to a <em>c</em>, a <em>d</em> to
a <em>d</em>, not to a <em>t</em>, and so on. There is, however, one remarkable
exception, namely, that no distinction is made between the guttural <em>c</em>
(as in <em>cūðe</em>) and the palatal <em>c</em> (as in <em>cēosan</em>), nor between
the guttural <em>g</em> (as in <em>god</em>) and the palatal <em>g</em> (as in <em>gierede</em>),
not even when the latter represents Germanic <em>j</em> (as in <em>geong</em>,
<em>gēar</em>). With exceptions hereafter to be noted, a consonant followed
by a vowel may alliterate with itself followed by another consonant:
thus <em>cūðe</em> alliterates not only with words like <em>cyning</em>, but
with words like <em>cræft</em>, <em>cwellan</em>; and <em>hūs</em> alliterates not
only with <em>heofon</em> but with <em>hlēapan</em>, <em>hnǣgan</em>, &amp;c. The fact
that different vowels, as <em>ī</em>, <em>ū</em>, and <em>æ</em> in <em>īsig ond
ūtfūs æðelinges fær</em> Beow. 33, alliterate together is only an
apparent exception to the strictness of the rule, as it is really
the glottal catch or <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">spiritus lenis</em><a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> before all vowels which
alliterates here. Wherever a vowel seems to alliterate with an <em>h</em> we
are justified in assuming a corruption of the text, as in <em>óretmecgas
æfter hǽleðum frægn</em> Beow. 332, where Grein improves both sense and
metre by substituting <em>æðelum</em> for <em>hæleðum</em>; other examples are <a href="#CORR_0" id="CORR_0"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: Beow. 499 1542, 2095, 2930">Beow.
499, 1542, 2095, 2930</ins>. In some cases where foreign names beginning with
<em>h</em> occur we occasionally find instances of this inexact alliteration,
as <em>Hólofernus únlyfigendes</em> Jud. 180 and 7, 21, 46, contrasted with
<em>Hólofernus hógedon āninga</em> 250; in later works as in Ælfric’s
<cite>Metrical Homilies</cite> we find alliteration of <em>h</em> with a vowel not only
in foreign names but with native words, as</p>

<div class="iline">and he <b>ǣ́</b>fre his fýrde&nbsp; &nbsp; þam <b>hǣ́</b>lende betǣ́hte. <span class="attrib">Ælfr. Judges<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> 417.</span></div>

<p>and <em>h</em> before consonants (viz. <em>r</em>, <em>l</em>, <em>w</em>) is disregarded as</p>

<div class="lines-container">

<p>It is important to observe that the combinations <em>st</em>, <em>sc</em>, <em>sp</em> are
not allowed to alliterate with each other or with words beginning
with <em>s</em> not followed by a consonant, but <em>st</em> can alliterate only
with <em>st</em>, <em>sc</em> only with <em>sc</em>, <em>sp</em> only with <em>sp</em>; thus <em>spere</em> and
<em>scyld</em>, <em>stillan</em> and <em>springan</em>, <em>sǣ</em> and <em>styrman</em> do not count as
alliterations. The invariable practice is seen in the following <span class="locked">lines:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="iline">hēt <b>st</b>rḗamfare <b>st</b>íllan, <b>st</b>órmas réstan. <span class="attrib">An. 1578.</span></div>

<div class="lines-container">

                        <span class="attrib">Byrhtnoth 136&ndash;7.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In later times this rule was not so strictly observed. The metrical
Psalms alliterate <em>sc</em> with <em>s</em> and <em>sw</em> with <em>s</em>, as</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">hi hine him <b>s</b>ámnuncga&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>sc</b>éarpum strḗlum. <span class="attrib">Ps. lxiii. 4.</span></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>but <em>sp</em> and <em>st</em> do not alliterate with each other or with <em>s</em>. In
Ælfric all these combinations of consonants alliterate indifferently
with each other or with <em>s</em> + another consonant or with simple <em>s</em>, as
in</p>

<div class="iline">wið þā́m þe hēo be<b>s</b>wī́ce&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>S</b>ámson þone <b>s</b>trángan.<span class="attrib">Ælfr. Judges 308.</span></div>

<p>Sometimes in Ælfric the alliterating letter does not stand at the
beginning of the word,</p>

<div class="iline">and hē hæfde héora ge<b>w</b>éald ealles t<b>w</b>éntig gḗara. <span class="attrib">ibid. 85.</span></div>

<p>and the alliteration may even fall on an unaccented particle as in</p>

<div class="iline"><b>f</b>rám his gelēafan and his ǣ <b>f</b>orsāwon. <span class="attrib">ibid. 51.</span></div>

<p>For a full account of Ælfric’s alliteration the reader may be referred
to an interesting essay by Dr. Arthur Brandeis, <cite>Die Alliteration in
Aelfric’s metrischen Homilien</cite>, 1897 (Programm der Staatsrealschule im
VII. Bezirk in Wien).</p>

§ <b>34. Position of the alliterative words.</b> Out of the four accented
syllables of the line two at least, and commonly three, must begin with
an alliterative sound, and this alliteration still further increases
the stress which these syllables have in virtue of their syntactical
and rhythmical accent.</p>

<p>The position of these alliterative sounds in the line may vary in the
same way as their number. The general laws which govern the position
of the alliteration are the following:&mdash;(i) One alliterating sound
<em>must</em>, and two <em>may</em> occur in the first hemistich; (ii) In the second
hemistich the alliterating sound (called the head-stave<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>) must fall
on the first of the two accented syllables of that hemistich, and the
second accented syllable in the second hemistich does not take part in
the alliteration at all; (iii) When there are three alliterating sounds
in the whole line two of them must be in the first hemistich and only
one in the second. Examples of lines with three alliterating sounds:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>s</b>éolfa he ge<b>s</b>étte &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>s</b>únnan ond mṓnan. <span class="attrib">Sat. 4.</span></div>
    <div class="line"><b>ú</b>fan ond <b>ū̀</b>tan&nbsp; &nbsp; him wæs <b>ǣ́</b>ghwǣr wā́. <span class="attrib">Sat. 342.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Lines with only two alliterative sounds, the first of which may coincide
with either of the accented syllables of the first hemistich (the second
of course coinciding with the first accented syllable of the second
hemistich) are very common:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>h</b>ḗafod éalra&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>h</b>ḗahgescéafta. <span class="attrib">Gen. 4.</span></div>
    <div class="line">hī hýne þā æt<b>b</b>ǣ́ron to <b>b</b>rímes fároðe. <span class="attrib">Beow. 28.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>If the first hemistich contains only one alliterative sound this
alliteration generally falls on the more emphatic of the two accented
syllables of the hemistich which is usually the first, as</p>

<div class="iline">on <b>f</b>lṓdes ǣ́ht&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>f</b>éor gewī́tan. <span class="attrib">Beow. 42.</span></div>

<p>In the type A the single alliteration of the first hemistich not
unfrequently falls on the second accented syllable, such cases being
distinguished, as <span class="gesperrt">A3</span></p>

<div class="iline">þā́ wæs on <b>b</b>úrgum &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>B</b>ḗowulf Scýldinga. <span class="attrib">Beow. 53.</span></div>

<p>In types C and D the single alliteration of the first section must
always fall on the first accented syllable which in these types is
more emphatic than the second. In types B and E <a class="pagenum" name="Pg_49" id="Pg_49" title="49"></a>alliteration on the
second arsis would bring the alliteration too near to the end of the
hemistich, and is therefore rare.</p>

<p>Double alliteration in the first hemistich occurs in all of the five
types, and chiefly when the two accented syllables have equally strong
accents. It is, therefore, least common in C <span class="scansion">×–́|–́×</span> where the
first arsis predominates over the second, and is most frequent in the
strengthened hemistichs, in D, E, <span class="gesperrt">A2</span>, and in the five-membered D*
types, where it is the <span class="locked">rule.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>A third form of alliteration, though much less important and frequent
than these two, occurs when the second accented syllable of the second
hemistich shares in alliteration, in addition to the first accented
syllable. There are then two different pairs of alliterative sounds
distributed alternately between the two hemistichs. The commonest form
of this double alliteration of the whole line is represented by the
formula a b | a b, as</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">hwæt! we <b>G</b>ā́r<b>d</b>éna&nbsp; &nbsp; in <b>g</b>ḗar<b>d</b>águm. <span class="attrib">Beow. 1.</span></div>
    <div class="line"><b>Sc</b>ýldes <b>é</b>aferan&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Sc</b>édelandum <b>í</b>n. <span class="attrib">Beow. 19.</span></div>
    <div class="line"><b>h</b>ílde<b>w</b>ǣ́þnum&nbsp; &nbsp; ond <b>h</b>éaðo<b>w</b>ǣ́dum. <span class="attrib">Beow. 39;</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>less commonly by the formula a b | b a:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">þā <b>w</b>ǣ́ron <b>m</b>ónige  þe his <b>m</b>ǣ́g <b>w</b>ríðon. <span class="attrib">Beow. 2982.</span></div>
    <div class="line"><b>h</b>wī́lum for <b>d</b>úguðe    <b>d</b>óhtor <b>H</b>rṓðgà̄res.<span class="attrib">Beow. 2020;</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>verses corresponding to the formula a a | b b are not found in early
poetry. No doubt certain instances of this double alliteration may be
accidental, but others seem intentional.</p>

<p>The foregoing rules as to alliteration are strictly observed in the
early and classic poetry, but in later times certain licences crept in.
Three of these may be noticed. (i) The second accented syllable of the
second hemistich is allowed to carry the alliteration instead of the
first accented syllable,</p>

<div class="iline"><b>l</b>ā́stas <b>l</b>égde &nbsp; oððǽt hē ge<b>l</b>ǣ́dde. <span class="attrib">Gen. 2536.</span></div>

<p>(ii) Both accented syllables of the second hemistich alliterate with one
accented syllable of the first <span class="locked">hemistich,<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></span></p>

<div class="iline">me <b>s</b>éndon tṓ þē&nbsp; <b>s</b>ǣ́men <b>s</b>nélle. <span class="attrib">Byrhtnoth 29.</span></div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_50" id="Pg_50" title="50"></a></p>

<p>(iii) The four accented syllables of the line all alliterate together,</p>

<div class="iline"><b>G</b>ódwine ond <b>G</b>ódwīg &nbsp; <b>g</b>ū̀de ne <b>g</b>ȳ́mdon. <span class="attrib">Byrhtn. 192.</span></div>

<p>In the majority of cases the same alliterative letter is not employed in
two successive lines, but we find cases like</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">þā tō<b>b</b>rǣ́d Sámson &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>b</b>ḗgen his éarmas</div>
    <div class="line">þæt þā rā́pas to<b>b</b>úrston &nbsp; &nbsp; þe he mid ge<b>b</b>únden wæs.<span class="attrib">Ælf. Judges 269;</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>and earlier in Andreas 70, 197, 372, 796, 815, 1087, &amp;c., or in Beowulf
403, 489, 644, 799, 865, 898, &amp;c.</p>

<p>And even three lines in succession, as</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">swýlce he ā<b>f</b>ḗdde &nbsp; &nbsp; of <b>f</b>íxum twā́m</div>
    <div class="line">ond of <b>f</b>ī́f hlā́fum &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>f</b>ī́ra cýnnes</div>
    <div class="line"><b>f</b>ī́f þū̀sendo; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>f</b>ḗðan sǣ́ton. <span class="attrib">An. 589 ff.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This usage, which in Middle English became very popular, is noticeably
frequent in the poem of Judith, probably with a view to emphasis. Many
examples of such pairs of verses are to be found collected by Dr. A.
Brandeis from Ælfric.</p>

<p>The unaccented words may begin with the same letter as the accented
words which bear the alliteration proper,<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> as</p>

<div class="iline">ne hīe huru <b>h</b>éofona <b>h</b>élm &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>h</b>érian ne cū̀ðon. <span class="attrib">Beow. 182,</span></div>

<p>or one of the unaccented words may begin with the same letter as an
accented word which does not alliterate, as</p>

<div class="iline">þæt fram <b>h</b>ā́m gefrǣ́gn &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>H</b>ígelāces bégn. <span class="attrib">Beow. 194;</span></div>

<p>this of course has nothing to do with alliteration, though in later
times it was often mistaken for it.</p>

<p>Verses without any alliteration at all, as</p>

<div class="iline">he hélpeð þéarfan &nbsp; &nbsp; swýlce ēac wǣ́dlan.<span class="attrib">Ps. lxxi. 13,</span></div>

<p>occur only in late OE. poetry like Ælfric’s Homilies, and when rhyme was
beginning to creep in.</p>

<p><a name="section35" id="section35"></a>
§ <b>35. Alliteration in relation to the parts of speech and to the order
the order of words.</b> Both alliteration and the whole structure of the
alliterative line depend in the first place on the natural or
etymological accent of the single words, and next on the syntactical
accent which these words bear in their<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_51" id="Pg_51" title="51"></a> relation to one another in the
sentence. Just as only the accented syllable of a single word can take
part in the alliteration, so only can those words take part in it which
are marked out in the sentence as important and therefore strongly
accented.</p>

<p>The relative degree of stress is influenced at times by the rhetorical
accent, but generally speaking we find a certain gradation of accent
among the accented words depending on their intrinsic and not on their
rhetorical importance in building up the sentence.</p>

<p>Two general principles may be laid down: (1) If the syntactical value
of the two accented syllables of the hemistich is not equal, then the
word which has the stronger accent of the two is chosen to alliterate.
In the second hemistich it is always the first accented word (the ‘head
stave’), in the first hemistich it is generally the first accented
word, though the second accented word may alliterate as well. (2) If
the two accented syllables of the section are equal in syntactical
value, then the first alliterates, and when double alliteration is
allowed the second may also alliterate.</p>

<p>The various grammatical classes of words are treated in regard to the
alliteration in the following <span class="locked">way:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><b>Nouns</b>, including adjectives and the infinitives and participles of
verbs, have the strongest accent of all words in the sentence. A noun
therefore takes precedence over the other parts of speech among which
it occurs and has the alliteration, as</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">nḗ in þā <b>c</b>éastre &nbsp; &nbsp; be<b>c</b>úman méahte. <span class="attrib">An. 931.</span></div>
    <div class="line">híre þā <b>Á</b>dam &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>a</b>ndswárode. <span class="attrib">Gen. 827.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>If two nouns occur in the same hemistich it is always the first which
alliterates,</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>h</b>ū̀sa sḗlest. &nbsp; &nbsp; Wæs sēo <b>h</b>wī́l micel. <span class="attrib">Beow. 146.</span></div>
    <div class="line"><b>l</b>ánge hwī́le. &nbsp; &nbsp; Him wæs <b>l</b>ī́ffrḗa.<span class="attrib">Beow. 16.</span></div>
    <div class="line"><b>g</b>éongum ond éaldum, &nbsp; &nbsp; swylc him <b>g</b>ód séalde.<span class="attrib">Beow. 72.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The only exceptions are when a special rhetorical emphasis is given to
the second word.</p>

<p>When a noun and two adjectives or two nouns and an adjective occur in
the same hemistich, one of these is always subordinated to the other,
and the two together are treated as a combination. In such cases, where
there is double alliteration <a class="pagenum" name="Pg_52" id="Pg_52" title="52"></a>in the hemistich, the position of the
alliterating words may be either <em>a a x</em>, or <em>a x a</em>, the subordinate
element (<em>x</em>) standing either in the last or the second place in the
hemistich,</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>b</b>éorht <b>b</b>ḗacen Gódes &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>b</b>rímu swáðredon. <span class="attrib">Beow. 570.</span></div>
    <div class="line"><b>t</b>wélf wintra tī́d &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>t</b>órn geþólode. <span class="attrib">Beow. 147.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In the case of single alliteration, it is always the first of the nouns
or adjectives which alliterates.</p>

<p><b>The verb</b> (excluding the infinitive and participles) is usually less
strongly accented than the noun. It may therefore precede or follow the
noun or adjective without alliteration, either in the arsis or thesis,
as</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">lḗt se <b>h</b>éarda &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>H</b>ígelāces þégn.<span class="attrib">Beow. 2977.</span></div>
    <div class="line">him þā <b>Sc</b>ýld gewā́t &nbsp; &nbsp;tō ge<b>sc</b>ǽp-hwī́le.<span class="attrib">Beow. 26.</span></div>
    <div class="line">gewāt þā <b>t</b>wélfa súm &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>t</b>órne gebólhen.<span class="attrib">Beow. 2401.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>On the other hand, when a hemistich consists only of one noun and one
verb, the verb may alliterate, as</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>g</b>ṓdne ge<b>g</b>ýrwan &nbsp; &nbsp;cwæð hē <b>g</b>ū̀ð-cýning. <span class="attrib">Beow. 199.</span></div>
    <div class="line"><b>h</b>wḗtton <b>h</b>ígerōfne &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>h</b>ǣ́l scḗawedon. <span class="attrib">Beow. 204.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When a substantive and an adjective are closely combined, a verb in the
same hemistich may alliterate, as</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>b</b>ýreð <b>b</b>lṓdig wæl, &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>b</b>ýrgean þénceð. <span class="attrib">Beow. 448.</span></div>
    <div class="line"><b>s</b>éofon niht <b>s</b>wúncon; &nbsp; &nbsp;hē þē æt <b>s</b>únde oferflā́t. <span class="attrib">Beow. 517.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In formulas consisting of noun + verb the noun predominates over the verb
and takes the alliteration, as</p>

<div class="iline"><b>w</b>érodes <b>w</b>ī́sa <b>w</b>órdhord onlḗac.<span class="attrib">Beow. 259.</span></div>

<p>But if the verb is emphatic it may alliterate though there is a noun in
the same hemistich; this occurs chiefly in the second hemistich, as</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">ond be <b>h</b>éalse genám; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>h</b>rúron him tḗaras.<span class="attrib">Beow. 1872.</span></div>
    <div class="line"><b>g</b>rýrelī̀cne <b>g</b>íst. &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>G</b>ýrede hine Beowulf.<span class="attrib">ib. 1441,</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>but a few instances are found in the first hemistich, as</p>

<div class="iline">ge<b>m</b>únde þā se <b>g</b>ṓda <b>m</b>ǣ́g Hígelā́ces.<span class="attrib">Beow. 758.</span></div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_53" id="Pg_53" title="53"></a></p>

<p>When one of two verbs in the hemistich is subordinate to the other the
verb in the subordinate clause alliterates, having a stronger accent
than the verb in the main clause,</p>

<div class="iline">mýnte þæt hē ge<b>d</b>ǣ́lde &nbsp; &nbsp;ǣr þon <b>d</b>ǽg cwṓme.<span class="attrib">Beow. 731.</span></div>

<p>If the two verbs are co-ordinate the first alliterates,</p>

<div class="iline"><b>w</b>órolde lī́fes: &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>w</b>ýrce sē þe mṓte.<span class="attrib">Beow. 1387;</span></div>

<p>in the first hemistich both verbs commonly alliterate,</p>

<div class="iline"><b>s</b>éomade ond <b>s</b>ýrede &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>s</b>ínnìhte hḗold.<span class="attrib">Beow. 161.</span></div>

<p><b>The adverb.</b> Adverbs of degree like <em>micle</em>, <em>swīðe</em>, <em>ful</em>, &amp;c., are
commonly found in the thesis, and even if they stand in the arsis they
usually do not alliterate, as</p>

<div class="iline"><b>ó</b>ftor mícle &nbsp; &nbsp;þonne on <b>ǣ́</b>nne sī́ð.<span class="attrib">Beow. 1580.</span></div>

<p>When adverbs of this kind have a special rhetorical emphasis they may of
course alliterate, as</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">éfne swā <b>m</b>ícle    swā bið <b>m</b>ǣ́gða cræft. <span class="attrib">Beow. 1284.</span></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Adverbs which modify the meaning of the word which they precede
alliterate, as</p>

<div class="iline"><b>ǣ́</b>scholt <b>ú</b>fan grǣ̀g: &nbsp; &nbsp; wæs sē <b>ī́</b>renþrḗat.<span class="attrib">Beow. 330.</span></div>

<p>Adverbial prepositions preceding the verb also alliterate,</p>

<div class="iline">hēt þā <b>ū́</b>p béran &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>ǣ́</b>ðelìnga gestrḗon.<span class="attrib">Beow. 1920,</span></div>

<p>but not when they follow the verb,</p>

<div class="iline"><b>G</b>ḗat wæs <b>g</b>lǽdmōd, &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>g</b>éong sṑna tṓ.<span class="attrib">Beow. 1785.</span></div>

<p>Adverbs derived from nouns are more strongly accented than the verb
which they modify and therefore alliterate,</p>


<div class="iline">ālégdon þā tō<b>m</b>íddes &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>m</b>ǣ́rne þḗoden.
              <span class="attrib">Beow. 3141.</span></div>

<p><b>Pronouns</b> (and pronominal adjectives like <em>monig</em>, <em>eall</em>, <em>fela</em>) are
usually enclitic, and precede or follow the noun without alliterating,
as</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">manigu <b>ṓ</b>ðru <ins class="correction" title="original: gesćeaft">gescéaft</ins><a name="CORR_1" id="CORR_1"></a> &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>é</b>fnswī̀ðe hím.<span class="attrib">Metr. xi. 44.</span></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_54" id="Pg_54" title="54"></a></p>

<p>With a special rhetorical accent they may alliterate even if they
precede the noun,</p>

<div class="iline">on <b>þ</b>ǣ́m dǽge <b>þ</b>ýsses lī́fes.<span class="attrib">Beow. 197.</span></div>

<p>The pronoun <em>self</em>and the pronouns compounded with the prefix <em>ǣ</em>
(<em>ǣghwā</em>, <em>ǣghwylc</em>, &amp;c.) are usually accented, and alliterate
if they form the first arsis of the hemistich, as</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>s</b>ḗlran ge<b>s</b>ṓhte þǣm be him <b>s</b>elfa dḗah.<span class="attrib">Beow. 1840.</span></div>
    <div class="line">hǽfde <b>ǣ́</b>ghwæðer <b>é</b>nde gefḗred.<span class="attrib">Beow. 2845.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><b>Prepositions, conjunctions, and particles</b> are not as a rule accented,
but prepositions if followed by an enclitic pronoun take the accent and
alliterate, as</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>é</b>aldum <b>é</b>arne and <b>ǣ́</b>fter þón. <span class="attrib">Phoen. 238.</span></div>
    <div class="line">nis <b>ú</b>nder mḗ <b>ǣ́</b>nig <b>ṓ</b>ðer. <span class="attrib">Riddle xli. 86.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Whether words of these classes, standing in the first arsis of the first
hemistich along with another alliterating word, were intended also to
alliterate is somewhat uncertain, but it is probable that they were so,
as in</p>

<p>These laws of accentuation are strictly observed only in the older
poetry; by the end of the tenth century, in Byrhtnoth, the Metres of
Boethius and the Psalms, they are frequently neglected.</p>

§ <b>36. Arrangement and relationship of verse and sentence.</b> The
following rules hold good in general for the distribution of the
sentence or parts of the sentence between the hemistichs of the verse.
Two distinct pauses occur in every alliterative line, one (commonly
called the caesura) between the first and second hemistichs, the
other at the end of the line, and these pauses are determined by the
syntactical construction; that is to say, they coincide with the end
of a clause or lesser member of the sentence. The hemistich must
contain such parts of the sentence as belong closely together; and such
coherent parts, as, for example, a pronoun and noun to which it refers
or adverb with adjective, must not be separated from one another by the
caesura, unless the pronoun or adverb is placed in the second arsis of
the hemistich, as</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>w</b>ýrd æfter þíssum &nbsp; <b>w</b>órdgeméarcum.<span class="attrib">Gen. 2355.</span></div>
    <div class="line">gif ge wíllað <b>m</b>ī́nre &nbsp; <b>m</b>íhte gelḗfan.<span class="attrib">Sat. 251.</span></div>
   </div>
</div>

<p>In Beowulf this separation of closely connected words is <a class="pagenum" name="Pg_55" id="Pg_55" title="55"></a>permitted only
if the word standing in the arsis alliterates at the same time. Longer
parts of a sentence may be separated both by the caesura and the pause
at the end of the line. The syntactical connexion between the parts of a
sentence thus broken up makes the unity of the parts clear, and when the
division occurs in the caesura between the two halves of the verse, the
alliteration common to both hemistichs serves further to emphasize this
unity.</p>

<p>The single alliterative lines are connected with one another by the
prevailing usage of ending the sentence not at the end of the completed
line, but at the end of the first hemistich or in the middle of the
line, and of beginning a new sentence with the second hemistich. The
great variety of expression, and the predilection for paraphrase by
means of synonyms which is so characteristic of OE. poetry, contribute
to make such breaks in the line easy. Whatever may be the explanation,
it is certainly the fact that in the OE. poetry the metrical and
syntactical members do sometimes coincide, but at other times overlap in
a way which does not admit of being reduced to <span class="locked">rule.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></span></p>


<h4>The Lengthened Verse</h4>

<p><a name="section37" id="section37"></a>
§ <b>37.</b> Besides the normal four-beat line (with two beats to
each hemistich) there is in OE. and Old Saxon another variety,
the <b>lengthened line</b> (<em>Schwellvers</em>) with three beats in each
hemistich.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> These verses occur in almost all OE. poems, either
isolated or more commonly in groups, and occasionally we find lines with
one hemistich of two beats and the second hemistich of three, like.</p>

<div class="iline"><b>g</b>ā́stes dúgeðum&nbsp; &nbsp; þǣ́ra þe mid <b>g</b>ā́res órde. <span class="attrib">Gen. 1522,</span></div>

<p>and <cite>Jud.</cite>96, <cite>Crist</cite>1461, &amp;c., or with a lengthened hemistich of
three beats and a normal hemistich of two beats, like</p>

<div class="iline"><b>b</b>ǣ́ron <b>b</b>rándas on <b>b</b>rýne <b>b</b>lā́can fȳ́res. <span class="attrib">Dan. 246,</span></div>

<p>and <cite>Sat.</cite>605, <cite>Gnom. Ex.</cite>200, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Psalms</cite> and in Cynewulf’s <cite>Juliana</cite> they are wanting entirely,
in Cynewulf’s <cite>Elene</cite> out of 1321 verses there are only fourteen
lengthened whole lines, and three lengthened hemistichs.<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_56" id="Pg_56" title="56"></a> Examples
of groups of these lengthened verses will be found in <cite>Gen.</cite> 44&ndash;46,
1015&ndash;1019, 2167&ndash;2169, 2854&ndash;2858; <cite>Exodus</cite> 569&ndash;573, <cite>Dan.</cite> 59&ndash;106,
203&ndash;205, 226&ndash;228, 238&ndash;246, 262&ndash;271, 435&ndash;438, 441, 448, 452&ndash;458;
<cite>Judith</cite> 2&ndash;12, 16&ndash;21, 30&ndash;34, 54&ndash;61, 63&ndash;68, 88&ndash;99, 272&ndash;274, 289&ndash;291,
338&ndash;349; <cite>Satan</cite> 202, 232, 237, 605, <cite>Crist</cite> 621, 889, 922, 1050,
1382&ndash;1386, &amp;c., and in many of the smaller <span class="locked">poems.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Lengthened verses of a looser type occur in <cite>Salomon and Saturn</cite>, and
<cite>Genesis</cite> B; they have unusually long theses of four or five unaccented
syllables after the first accented syllable, as</p>

<div class="iline">ǣ́nne hæfde hē swā swī́ðne gewórhtne. <span class="attrib">Gen. 252,</span></div>

<p>or have equally long anacruses before the first accented syllable, as</p>

<div class="iline">þæt wē him on þām lánde lā́ð gefrémedon. <span class="attrib">Gen. 392.</span><a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></div>

<p>It is not always possible to draw a sharp distinction between regular
lines with somewhat long first theses and lengthened lines. The general
tone and rhythm of the passage in question help to determine whether we
have the normal or the lengthened line before us. The lengthened line
occurs in places where the sense demands a solemn and slow rhythm, in
other cases where the movement of the passage is quicker we may assume
a normal four-beat line with a long anacrusis, or a polysyllabic thesis
in the middle of the hemistich. What distinguishes clearly undoubted
examples of the lengthened verse is that in each hemistich we find
three beats and three feet of equal and independent value. But, as in
the usual two-beat hemistich of the normal line, both beats need not
be equally strong, so in the three-beat hemistich the three beats do
not always stand on the same footing as regards stress, nor does the
position of the stronger beat require to be always the same in the
two hemistichs. The beats which are accompanied by alliteration are,
generally speaking, stronger than those without alliteration. In the
employment of alliteration and in the structure of the hemistich the
lengthened line is closely allied to the normal line.</p>

<p><b>Alliteration.</b> 1. The first hemistich has commonly two alliterative
sounds, which fall as a rule on the first and second beats:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">ge<b>s</b>ēoð <b>s</b>órga mǣ́ste. <span class="attrib">Crist 1209;</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_57" id="Pg_57" title="57"></a></p>

<p>more rarely on the second and third beats, as in</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">wǣ́ron hyra <b>r</b>ǣ́das <b>r</b>ī́ce.<span class="attrib">Dan. 497;</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>sometimes on the first and third beats, as</p>

<div class="iline"><b>l</b>ī́f hēr mén for<b>l</b>ḗosað.<span class="attrib">Rhyming Poem 56.</span></div>

<p>Now and then we find hemistichs with three alliterations:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>d</b>ól bið sē þe him <b>d</b>ríhten ne on<b>d</b>rǣ́deð.<span class="attrib">Seafarer 106,</span></div>
    <div class="line"><b>þ</b>ȳ́ sceal on <b>þ</b>ḗode ge<b>þ</b>ḗon.<span class="attrib">Gnom. Ex. 50;</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>and others with one alliteration only, in which case the alliteration
falls more rarely on the first beat, as</p>

<div class="iline"><b>c</b>ýning sceal rī́ce héaldan &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>c</b>éastra bēoð féorran gesȳ́ne.
                <span class="attrib">Gnom. Ex. 1,</span></div>

<p>than on the second, as</p>

<div class="iline">þæt sē wǣ́re <b>m</b>íhta wáldend &nbsp; &nbsp;sē þe hī́e of þām <b>m</b>írce
     genérede. <span class="attrib">Dan. 448.</span></div>

<p>2. In the second hemistich the chief alliterative sound, the head-stave,
generally falls on the second accented syllable, as in the last example,
and only exceptionally on the first accented syllable, as</p>

<div class="iline"><b>St</b>ȳ́ran sceal mon <b>st</b>róngum mṓde. &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>St</b>órm oft hólm gebríngeð.<br />
                                          <span class="attrib">Gnom. Ex. 51.</span></div>

<p><a name="section38" id="section38"></a>
§ <b>38. The origin and structure of the lengthened verse.</b> It is clear
from the comparative infrequency and the special use to which it is put
that the lengthened line must be looked upon as originating in some way
from the normal four-beat line. Two explanations of its development have
been given. The first, which is Sievers’s original view,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> is that a
foot or measure with the form <span class="scansion">–́...</span> (i.e. one accented syllable plus
several unaccented ones) was prefixed to one of the five normal types;
hence <span class="scansion">–́×</span> prefixed to A would give the form <span class="scansion">–́×|–́×–́×</span>, and <span class="scansion">–×</span>
prefixed to B would give <span class="scansion">–́×|×–́×–́</span>. The other explanation, given
by Luick,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> is that the lengthened hemistich is due to a blending of
several types of the normal kind in this way. The hemistich starts with
the beginning of one of the normal types A, B, C, then with the second
accented syllable another type <a class="pagenum" name="Pg_58" id="Pg_58" title="58"></a>is begun and continued, as if the poet
found the original beginning inadequate to express his emotion.</p>

<p>The manner in which the blending of two normal types results in new
lengthened types of three beats will be seen in the following
illustrations:</p>

<p>As Prof. Sievers himself<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> has accepted this theory (or, at least,
has recognized it as a convenient method of exhibiting the structural
varieties of the lengthened line), we shall adopt it here.</p>

<p>Of the fifteen different possible combinations of the original types,
some do not actually occur, but with the sub-types to be taken into
consideration we get no less than eighteen different types of the
regular lengthened whole line, and these again admit of variations by
means of resolution of accented syllables, polysyllabic theses, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_59" id="Pg_59" title="59"></a></p>

<p>Only the most commonly occurring forms of the lengthened hemistich will
be given here; for the others the reader may be referred to Sievers.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="section39" id="section39"></a>
§ <b>39.</b> By far the most common type is <b>A A</b> (some 525 examples),</p>

<p class="center"><span class="scansion">–́×...–́×.–́×,</span></p>

<p>as in</p>

<div class="iline"><b>w</b>éaxan <b>w</b>ī́tebrṓgan.  <span class="normal">(</span>Hǽfden  hīe <b>w</b>rṓhtgetḗme<span class="normal">)</span>.
<span class="attrib">Gen. 45;</span></div>

<p>or with resolution of the first accented syllable in the first
hemistich,</p>

<div class="iline"><b>s</b>únu mid <b>s</b>wéordes écge. <span class="attrib">Gen. 2857,</span></div>

<p>and in the second hemistich,</p>

<div class="iline"><b>f</b>éla bið <b>f</b>ýrwet-géornra. <span class="attrib">Gnom. Ex. 102;</span></div>

<p>with resolution of the second accented syllable in the second hemistich,</p>

<div class="iline">þǣ́r þū þólades <b>s</b>íððan. <span class="attrib">Crist 1410;</span></div>

<p>or of each of the three accented syllables in the second hemistich,</p>

<div class="iline">hýre þæs <b>f</b>ǣ́der on róderum. <span class="attrib">Jud. 5.</span></div>

<p>The chief variation of this type arises from the prolongation of
the first thesis, which may run from one to six syllables. At the
same time the usual resolutions may be introduced, as in the
following examples: Ordinary type, <span class="scansion">–́××||–́×|–́×</span>, very common,</p>

<p>Other combinations are given by Sievers, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Altgermanische Metrik</cite>,

<p>and others in Sievers’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Altgermanische Metrik</cite>, § 96.</p>


<h4>Formation of Stanzas and Rhyme.</h4>

<p><a name="section40" id="section40"></a>
§ <b>40.</b> OE. poetry is mainly narrative, and does not run into any kind
of recurring stanza or strophe, but is entirely stichic. Traces of an
arrangement of lines so as to form a stanza are found in Dēor, the
Runic Poem, the Psalms and Hymns, the so-called First Riddle, and in
the Gnomic verses of the Exeter Book, which may be compared to the Old
French <span class="locked">‘tirades’.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, end-rhyme of the two hemistichs, combined with
alliteration, is not very uncommon, though in most cases it seems only
an incidental ornament, as</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>f</b>ýlle ge<b>f</b>ǣ́gon; <b>f</b>ǽgere geþǣ́gon.<span class="attrib">Beow. 1014.</span></div>
    <div class="line"><b>w</b>órd-gyd <b>w</b>récan ond ymb <b>w</b>ér sprécan.<span class="attrib">Beow. 3172.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In the Rhyming Poem of the Exeter Book we have eighty-seven lines in
which the first and second hemistichs rhyme throughout, and in some
passages of other poems, noticeably in the <cite>Elene</cite>, vv. 114&ndash;115, and
vv. 1237&ndash;1251, in which Cynewulf speaks in his own person, or Crist
591&ndash;595, And. 869&ndash;871, 890, Gūthl. 801, Phoen. 15&ndash;16, 54&ndash;55;
assonance is found not unfrequently alongside of perfect rhyme, as in
Gūthl. 802, Phoen. 53. These places are sufficient to prove a
systematic and deliberate use of rhyme, which serves to accentuate
the lyrical tone of the passages.</p>

<p>Monosyllabic rhymes such as <em>nān: tān</em> (Rhym. Poem 78), <em>rād:
gebā́d</em> (ib. 16), <em>onlā́h: onwrā́h</em> (ib. 1) are called masculine,
and disyllabic rhymes like <em>wóngum: góngum</em> (ib. 7), <em>géngdon:
méngdon</em> (ib. 11), or trisyllabic <em>hlýnede: dýnede</em> (ib. 28), <em>swínsade:
mínsade</em> (ib. 29), <em>bífade: hlífade</em> (ib. 30), are called feminine.</p>

<p>According to their position in the hemistich, rhymes fall into<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_63" id="Pg_63" title="63"></a> two
classes (<em>a</em>) interior rhymes like <em>hónd rónd gefḕng</em> Beow. 2609,
<em>stī́ðmṑd gestṓd</em> Beow. 2567, in compounds <em>wórd-hòrd ontḗac</em>
Beow. 259, in co-ordinate formulae like <em>þā wæs sǣ́l and mǣ́l</em>
Beow. 1008, <em>wórdum and bórdum</em> El. 24, <em>grund ond sund</em> And. 747, and
as so-called grammatical rhymes <em>lāð wið lāðum</em> Beow. 440, <em>béarn
æfter béarne</em>, Gen. 1070; (<em>b</em>) sectional rhymes joining the two halves
of one line, as</p>

<div class="iline"><b>s</b><em>écgas mec</em> <b>s</b><em>ǣ́gon</em> <b>s</b><em>ýmbel ne ālǣ́gon.</em> <span class="attrib">Rhym. P. 5;</span></div>

<p>not unfrequently, very often in the Rhyming Poem, two, three, four or
more alliterative lines are connected in this fashion.</p>

<p>The OE. end rhymes are either (<em>a</em>) complete rhymes as <em>hond: rond</em>,
<em>gefǣ́gon: geþǣ́gon</em>, or (<em>b</em>) assonances, in which only the
vowels correspond, as <em>wæf: læs</em> El. 1238; <em>wrā́ðum: ā́rum</em> Crist.
595; <em>lúfodon: wúnedon</em> And. 870; that the assonances are not
accidental is clear from the fact that they occur alongside of perfect
<span class="locked">rhymes.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER  III<br />
<span class="subtitle">
THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE FREER<br />
  FORM OF THE ALLITERATIVE LINE IN LATE<br />
  OLD ENGLISH AND EARLY MIDDLE ENGLISH</span></h3>


<h4>A. Transitional Forms.</h4>

<p><a name="section41" id="section41"></a>
§ <b>41. Increasing frequency of Rhyme.</b> The alliterative line was, as
we have seen, the only kind of verse known in English poetry down to
the end of the Old English period. In the eleventh century, however,
the strict conventions which governed the use of alliteration began
to be relaxed and, at the same time, end-rhyme began to invade the
alliterative line, and by this means it was resolved in the course of
time into two separate lines. The process by which this came about is
of great importance in enabling us to follow the further development of
English versification. It has two <span class="locked">varieties:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. Systematic combination of end-rhyme and alliteration.</p>

<p>2. Unintentional or accidental combination of rhyme and alliteration.</p>

<p>The former&mdash;the intentional combination of rhyme with
alliteration&mdash;never became popular in Old English; indeed, the few
examples previously quoted are all that have been preserved. In these
examples the hemistichs of each line conform to the ancient rules with
regard to their rhythmic and alliterative structure, but are more
uniform in type than was usual in the older poetry, and are more closely
paired together by the use of final rhyme, which occurs in all its three
varieties, monosyllabic, disyllabic, and trisyllabic.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line"><b>w</b>úniende <b>w</b>ǣ́r <b>w</b>ílbec biscǣ́r.</div>
    <div class="line"><b>s</b>céalcas wǣron <b>sc</b>éarpe, <b>sc</b>ýl wæs héarpe,</div>
    <div class="line"><b>hl</b>ū̀de <b>hl</b>ýnede; <b>hl</b>éoðor dýnede.</div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="attribution">Rhyming Poem 26&ndash;28.</div>

<p>The rhythm of the verse is mostly descending, Type A being the prevalent
form, while Types D and E occur more rarely. The Types B and C, however,
are also found. Possibly this kind of verse was formed on the model of
certain Mediaeval Latin rhymed verses, or, somewhat more probably, on
that of the Old Norse ‘<span lang="non" xml:lang="non">runhenda</span>’, as this poetic form may have been<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_65" id="Pg_65" title="65"></a>
made known in England by the Old Norse poet, Egil Skallagrimsson, who in
the tenth century had lived in England and twice stayed at the court of
King Æõelstan.</p>

<p><a name="section42" id="section42"></a>
§ <b>42.</b> Of greater interest than this systematic combination of
alliteration and rhyme is the irregular and more or less unintentional
occurrence of rhyme which in the eleventh century is found frequently in
the native metre.</p>

<p>Isolated instances of rhyme or assonance may be met with even in the
oldest Old English poems. For certain standing expressions linked by
such a similarity of sound, mostly causing interior rhyme (i.e. rhyme
within a hemistich), were admitted now and then in alliterative poetry,
e.g.</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">siþþan ic <b>h</b>ónd and rónd | <b>h</b>ébban míhte. <span class="attrib">Beow. 656.</span></div>
    <div class="line"><b>s</b>ǣ́la and mǣ́la; | þat is <b>s</b>ṓd métod. <span class="attrib">ib. 1611.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In other cases such rhymes are to be found at the end of two hemistichs,</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Hrṓðgār máðelode, | <b>h</b>ílt scḗawode. <span class="attrib">Beow. 1687.</span></div>
    <div class="line"><b>W</b>ýrmum bewúnden, | <b>w</b>ítum gebúnden. <span class="attrib">Judith 115.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Examples of this kind occur not unfrequently in several early OE.
poems, but their number increases decidedly in the course of time from
<cite>Beowulf</cite>, <cite>Andreas</cite>, <cite>Judith</cite>, up to <cite>Byrhtnoth</cite> and <cite>Be Dōmes
dæge</cite>.</p>

<p>From the two last-mentioned poems, still written in pure alliterative
verse, a few examples of rhyming-alliterative verses, or of simply
rhymed verses occurring accidentally among the normal alliterative
lines, may also be quoted here:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>B</b>ýrhtnōð máðelode, | <b>b</b>órd háfenode.<span class="attrib">Byrhtn. 42.</span></div>
    <div class="line">ǣ́fre embe <b>st</b>únde | he <b>s</b>éalde sume wúnde.<span class="attrib">ib. 271.</span></div>
    <div class="line">þǣr þā wǽterbúrnan | swḗgdon and úrnon.<span class="attrib">Dom. 3.</span></div>
    <div class="line"><b>i</b>nnon þam gemónge | on <b>ǣ́</b>nlicum wónge.<span class="attrib">ib. 6.</span></div>
    <div class="line">nū̀ þū scealt <b>g</b>rḗotan, | tḗaras <b>g</b>ḗotan.<span class="attrib">ib. 82.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Thus it may be taken for granted that end-rhyme would have come into
use in England, even if Norman-French poetry had never been introduced,
although it is certainly not to be denied that it only became popular in
England owing to French influence.</p>

<p>But can this influence explain the gradually increasing use<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_66" id="Pg_66" title="66"></a> of
end-rhyme in some OE. poems written shortly before the Norman Conquest
(as e.g. <cite>Byrhtnoth</cite>, <cite>Be Dōmes dæge</cite>, the poetical passage in the
<cite>Saxon Chronicle</cite> of the year 1036), or are we to attribute it to
the influence of mediaeval hymn poetry, or, lastly, to the lingering
influence of the above-mentioned Old Norse ‘<span lang="non" xml:lang="non">runhenda</span>’? It is not easy to
give a decided answer to these questions.</p>

<p>In any case it would appear that towards the end of the Old English
period combined Mediaeval Latin and French influence on English metre
became of considerable importance on account of the constantly growing
intercourse between the British isles and the continent. This may
be seen in the more frequent use of rhyme, as indeed was only to be
expected in consequence of the increasing popularity of Norman-French
and Mediaeval-Latin poetry in England and the reception of Norman-French
words into the language.</p>

<p>This combination of alliteration and rhyme, however, only becomes
conspicuous to a considerable extent for the first time in the
above-mentioned passage of the <cite>Saxon Chronicle</cite>, and in another passage
of the year <span class="locked">1087.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The chief difference between these verses and those of the <cite>Rhyming
Poem</cite> is this, that the former have not such a symmetrical structure as
the latter, and that rhyme and alliteration are not combined in all of
them, but that regular alliterative lines, rhyming-alliterative lines,
and lines with rhyme only occur promiscuously, as e.g. in the following
lines (4&ndash;7) of the above-mentioned passage of the <cite>Chronicle</cite> of the
year 1036:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line"><b>s</b>úme hī man <b>b</b>énde, | <b>s</b>úme hī man <b>b</b>lénde,</div>
    <div class="line"><b>s</b>úme man <b>h</b>ámelode | and <b>s</b>úme <b>h</b>ḗanlīce <b>h</b>ǽttode;</div>
    <div class="line">ne wearþ <b>d</b>rḗorlīcre <b>d</b>ǣ́d | ge<b>d</b>ṓn on þisan éarde,</div>
    <div class="line">siððan Déne cṓmon | and hēr frýð nā́mon.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The verses of the year 1087 of the <cite>Saxon Chronicle</cite> have a similar
but on the whole less rhythmical structure. In some of the lines the
hemistichs are neither joined by alliteration, nor by end-rhyme, but
merely by the two-beat rhythm of each of them; cf. 11. 1&ndash;5:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Castelas he let wyrcean | and earme men swiðe swencean.</div>
    <div class="line">Se cyng wes swa swiðe stearc | and benam of his under-þeoddan</div>
    <div class="line"><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_67" id="Pg_67" title="67"></a>manig marc goldes | and ma hundred punda seolfres;</div>
    <div class="line">þat he nam be wihte | and mid mycelan unrihte</div>
    <div class="line">of his <b>l</b>and<b>l</b>eode | for <b>l</b>itelre neode.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>On the other hand, the poetical piece of the <cite>Saxon Chronicle</cite> on
Eadweard of the year 1065 is written in perfectly regular alliterative
lines.</p>

<p>These two ways of treating the old alliterative line which occur in
the latter part of the <cite>Saxon Chronicle</cite>, and which we will call the
progressive and the conservative treatment, indicate the course which
this metre was to take in its further development. Out of the long
alliterative line, separated by the caesura into two hemistichs, again
connected by rhyme, there sprang into existence a short rhyming couplet.
This was by no means identical with the three-beat couplet evolved from
two rhyming hemistichs of a line on the model of the French Alexandrine,
nor with the short four-beat couplets modelled on the French <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vers
octosyllabe</em>, but had points of similarity enough to both, especially to
the former one, to be easily used in conjunction with them, as several
Early English poems show.</p>

<p>The conservative treatment of the old alliterative line, which probably
at no time was altogether discontinued, was revived in the thirteenth
and especially in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, when it
degenerated again in the same way as the progressive line had done
several centuries before.</p>


<h4>B. The ‘Proverbs of Alfred’ and Layamon’s ‘Brut’.</h4>

<p><a name="section43" id="section43"></a>
§ <b>43.</b> The first subject which we have to consider here is the further
development of the progressive form of the alliterative line, the
representatives of which<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> are closely connected in their rhythmic
form with the two specimens of the poetical parts of the <cite>Saxon
Chronicle</cite> quoted above. From <cite>Alfred’s Proverbs</cite> we take No. xv (ll.
247&ndash;66):</p>

<p>These extracts illustrate only the general metrical character of the
two literary monuments, the versification of which in many passages
considerably deviates from the type here exhibited. It frequently shows
a still more arbitrary mixture of the different kinds of verse, or a
decided preference for some of them over the others. But the examples
given will suffice to show that here, as in the two passages from the
<cite>Saxon Chronicle</cite> quoted above, we have four different kinds of verse
distinguished by the different use of rhyme and alliteration, viz.:</p>

<p>1. Regular alliterative lines, which are very numerous, and at least in
the first half of Layamon’s <cite>Brut</cite>, possibly throughout <a class="pagenum" name="Pg_69" id="Pg_69" title="69"></a>the poem, form
the bulk, e.g. <cite>Prov.</cite> xv. 247&ndash;8, Layamon, 13847&ndash;8, 13851&ndash;2, 13855&ndash;6,
13859&ndash;60, 13867&ndash;8, 13881&ndash;2, or</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>B</b>úte if he <b>b</b>éo | in <b>b</b>óke iléred.<span class="attrib">Prov. iii. 65&ndash;6.</span></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>2. Rhyme (or assonance) and alliteration combined; equally numerous,
e.g. <cite>Prov.</cite> xv. 253&ndash;4, Lay. 13841&ndash;2, 13845&ndash;6, 13869&ndash;70, &amp;c., or</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Þat þe <b>ch</b>íriche habbe grýþ | and the <b>ch</b>éorl beo in frýþ.<span class="attrib">Prov. v. 93.</span></div>

    <div class="line">biuóren wende <b>H</b>éngest, | and <b>H</b>órs him alre <b>h</b>ǽndest.<span class="attrib">Lay. 13973&ndash;4.</span></div>
    <div class="line">Heo cómen into <b>h</b>álle | <b>h</b>ǽndeliche álle.<span class="attrib">ib. 13981&ndash;2.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>3. Verses with rhyme (or assonance) only, without alliteration, also not
unfrequent, e.g. <cite>Prov.</cite> xv. 249&ndash;50 ff., or Lay. 13853&ndash;4, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">And his plóuh beo idrýue | to ure álre bihóue. <span class="attrib">Prov. v. 97&ndash;8.</span></div>
    <div class="line">þe póure and þe ríche | démen ilýche. <span class="attrib">ib. iv. 80&ndash;1.</span></div>
    <div class="line">On Itálȝe heo comen to lónde, | þer Róme nou on stóndeþ. <span class="attrib">Lay. 106&ndash;7.</span></div>
    <div class="line">fele ȝér under súnnan | nas ȝet Róme biwónnen. <span class="attrib">ib. 108&ndash;9.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>4. Four-beat verses without either rhyme or alliteration, occurring
comparatively rarely, and in most cases probably to be attributed to
corruption of the text. Examples:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">he may béon on élde | wénliche lórþeu.<span class="attrib">Prov. vi. 101&ndash;2.</span></div>
    <div class="line">we habbeð séoue þúsund | of góde cníhten.<span class="attrib">Lay. 365&ndash;6.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It is certain that these four different forms of verse cannot have been
felt by the poets themselves as rhythmically unlike; their rhythmic
movement must have been apprehended as essentially one and the same.</p>

§ <b>44. Nature and origin of this metre. Theories of Trautmann and
Luick.</b> We need not here discuss the theory of Prof. Trautmann, who
endeavours to show that the hemistichs of Layamon’s verse were composed
in imitation of the four-beat short-lined metre in which the Old High
German poet Otfrid had written his religious poem <cite>Krist</cite>, a form which,
according to Trautmann and his followers, had been frequently employed
in late Old English and early Middle<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_70" id="Pg_70" title="70"></a> English poetry. References to the
criticisms of this hypothesis, by the present writer and others, are
given by G. Körting in his <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Encyklopädie der Englischen Philologie</cite>, p.
388, and by K. Luick in Paul’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Grundriss der Germanischen Philologie</cite>,
ed. 2, II. ii. 152. The author of this book, in his larger work on the
subject (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Englische Metrik</cite>, i. §§ 67&ndash;73), has shown, as English and
German scholars had done before him, that Layamon’s verse has its roots
in the Old English alliterative line. Twelve years after the publication
of that work this theory received further confirmation at the hands of
Prof. Luick, who has shown in Paul’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Grundriss</cite> (l.c.) that the five
types of the Old English alliterative line, discovered by Prof. Sievers,
reappear (although in a modified form) in the lines of Layamon’s <cite>Brut</cite>.
But we are unable wholly to agree with Prof. Luick’s view on the origin
and nature of this metre.</p>

<p>In order to explain the origin of Layamon’s verse he starts from the
hypothesis of Prof. Sievers<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> that the Old Germanic alliterative
verse, as historically known, which was intended to be <em>recited</em>,
and therefore not restricted to uniformity of rhythm, originated
from a primitive Old Germanic verse meant to be sung, and therefore
characterized by rhythmic regularity. According to Prof. Luick this
primitive metre, although not represented by any extant example in Old
English, had never quite died out, and forms the basis of the metre of
Layamon and his predecessors in early Middle English. For this ingenious
hypothesis, however, no real evidence exists. On the contrary, the fact
that the beginnings of the peculiar kind of metre used by Layamon can be
traced back to purely alliterative Old English poems, where they occur
amongst regular alliterative lines, and therefore undoubtedly must be
of the same rhythmical structure, seems to be decisive against Prof.
Luick’s theory.</p>

<p>For the same reason it is impossible to follow Prof. Luick in regarding
Layamon’s line as having an even-beat rhythm, and containing not only
two primary accents, but two secondary accents as well. A further strong
objection to this view is to be found in the circumstance, that in
the early part of Layamon’s <cite>Brut</cite>, although rhyme already occurs not
unfrequently, alliterative lines decidedly predominate; in the passage
consisting of forty long lines (ll. 106&ndash;185, quoted in our <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Altenglische
Metrik</cite>, pp. 152&ndash;3), we have thirty-three regular alliterative lines and
only five rhymed lines, two of which are alliterative at the same time.<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_71" id="Pg_71" title="71"></a>
Even in the middle portion of Layamon’s <cite>Chronicle</cite>, where the poet, as
Prof. Luick thinks, must have attained to a certain skill in handling
his metre, alliterative lines are in some passages quite as numerous as
rhymed ones. In the passage quoted above (p. 68), for example, which
consists of twenty-one long lines, eleven of them are alliterative and
ten are rhymed. On the other hand, in the continuation of this passage
(quoted <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Altengl. Metrik</cite>, p. 156), containing twenty-nine long lines,
the reverse is the case, the number of alliterative lines being only
seven, and that of rhymed and assonant lines twenty-two in all; of the
latter, however, eleven are alliterative at the same time.</p>

<p>While then it might be admissible to speak of progressive neglect of
alliteration and of increasing predilection for end-rhyme on the part of
the poet, as he advances with his work, it is not in accordance with the
facts to assert that ‘alliteration had ceased to play its former part,
and had been reduced to the level of a mere ornament of the verse’.
On the contrary, in the first part of the <cite>Chronicle</cite> alliteration is
the predominant form, and, as the work advances, it is still used to a
considerable extent as a means to connect the two hemistichs or short
lines so as to form one long line. The strict laws formerly observed in
the use of alliteration, it is true, are not unfrequently disregarded,
chiefly with respect to the head-stave, which often falls on the fourth
accented syllable of the long line; and other licences (first occurring
in Ælfric’s <cite>Metrical Homilies</cite>) may be met with. Nevertheless both
<cite>Alfred’s Proverbs</cite> and Layamon’s <cite>Brut</cite> (as is sufficiently shown by
the many specimens quoted in our <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Altenglische Metrik</cite>, pp. 150 ff.),
contain a great number of perfectly regular alliterative lines. The fact
that, in the second half of Layamon’s <cite>Chronicle</cite>, end-rhyme is used
more and more frequently as a means to connect the two hemistichs, is
with much more probability to be explained by the continual occupation
of the poet with the Norman-French original poem, and by the increasing
influence which its short octosyllabic couplets must naturally have
exercised upon his own rhythms, than by a supposed intention of the
poet to write in ‘primitive Germanic four-beat song-metre’, the very
existence of which is hypothetical. Furthermore, the fact that in
some (not all or even most) of the passages, where end-rhyme is used
almost exclusively, e.g. in the passage quoted above (ll. 13883&ndash;940),
an even-beat rhythm is distinctly noticeable, can be explained quite
naturally by the influence of the Norman-French original, the
even-measured verses of which the poet was translating.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_72" id="Pg_72" title="72"></a></p>

<p>But even supposing that Layamon <em>intended</em> to use the primitive Germanic
four-beat song-metre in his translation of Wace’s <cite>Chronicle</cite>, although
it certainly was not intended for singing, what can have been his reason
for composing the first half of his work, and a very considerable
portion of the rest, in a rhythmical form which only to a small extent
shows the peculiarities of a rhyming even-beat metre, whereas the main
part of it consists of the native unevenly stressed alliterative verse?
It is quite incorrect to say that the author in the course of his work
not unfrequently fell back into the alliterative verse. The fact is
just the opposite: the author started by using the native alliterative
verse to which he was accustomed, and gradually came to adopt the
rhymed verse of the Norman-French chronicle which he was translating,
without, however, entirely giving up the former metre. Alliteration
and end-rhyme, which he used sometimes separately and sometimes in
combination, were evidently looked upon by Layamon as equally legitimate
means for connecting his hemistichs or short lines.</p>

<p><a name="section45" id="section45"></a>
§ <b>45. Number of stresses.</b> Quite as unfounded as the assertion that
Layamon’s verse is of an even-beat nature is the other assertion that it
contains two primary and two secondary accents, and that the second of
these secondary accents in verses with disyllabic endings may fall on a
syllable which by its etymology ought to have no accent.</p>

<p>This statement is refuted by the treatment of rhyme in Layamon’s <cite>Brut</cite>
and in some earlier poems of a similar form or containing the same kind
of verse.</p>

<p>Not only in the <cite>Brut</cite>, but also in several Old English and earlier
Middle English poems, we meet both with regular rhymes and with simple
assonances and other still more imperfect correspondences in sound
intended to serve as rhymes.</p>

<p>Examples of actual rhyme in the <cite>Brut</cite> are the monosyllabic pairs:
<em>seon: beon</em> 13837&ndash;8, <em>king: þing</em> 13883&ndash;4, <em>cniht: riht</em> 13887&ndash;8;
besides inexact rhymes like <em>mon: anān</em> 13605&ndash;6, 13615&ndash;16, <em>mon:
dōn</em> 13665&ndash;6, 13677&ndash;8, <em>wīn: in</em> 14349&ndash;50, 14998&ndash;9, <em>chin:
wīn</em> 14994&ndash;5; disyllabic rhymes: <em>icúmen: gúmen</em> 13787&ndash;8, <em>gṓde:
flṓde</em> 13791&ndash;2, <em>sṓhten: rṓhten</em> 13803&ndash;4, <em>ṓðer:
brṓðer</em> 13841&ndash;2, <em>chī̀lde: wī́lde</em> 13870&ndash;1, <em>pḗre:
hḗre</em> 13871&ndash;2, <em>hálle: álle</em> 13981&ndash;2. We see no reason to accent
these last-mentioned rhymes differently from similar rhymes occurring
in Old English poems, as e.g. <em>wédde: aspḗdde</em> Andr. 1633, <em>wúnne:
blúnne</em> ib. 1382, <em>bewúnden: gebúnden</em> Jud. 115, <em>stúnde: wúnde</em>
Byrhtn. 271, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_73" id="Pg_73" title="73"></a></p>

<p>Examples of the more numerous group formed by assonances are <em>tō :
idōn</em> 13801&ndash;2, <em>lond: gold</em> 13959&ndash;60, <em>strong: lond</em> 13969&ndash;70, and
disyllabic assonances like <em>cníhten: kínges</em> 13793&ndash;4, <em>wólden: londe</em>
13821&ndash;2, &amp;c.</p>

<p>These are strictly parallel with instances like <em>wæf: læs</em> El. 1238,
<em>onlā́g: hād</em> ib. 1246, or like <em>wrā́ðum: ā́rum</em> Crist 595,
<em>lýre: cýme</em> Phoen. 53, <em>rǣ́dde: tǣ́hte</em> By. 18, <em>flā́nes:
genāme</em> ib. 71, <em>hlḗorum: tḗarum</em> Be Dōmes dæge 28,
&amp;c., and must, in our opinion, be metrically interpreted in exactly
the same way. That is to say, the root-syllable must, not only in
real assonances like <em>cníhten: kínges</em>, <em>lónde: strónge</em>, but also in
consonances like <em>Péohtes: cníhtes</em>, <em>mónnen: ínnen</em>, be looked upon
as the chief part of the rhyme, and the flexional endings, whether
rhyming correctly or incorrectly, must be regarded as forming only an
unessential, unaccented, indistinctly heard part of the rhyme, just as
they admittedly do in the similar Old English assonances quoted above.</p>

<p>Now, as it is inconsistent with the two-beat rhythm of the hemistich in
Old English verse, to attribute a secondary accent to those endings,
although they were in some cases more distinctly pronounced than the
Middle English endings, it is impossible to suppose that the Middle
English endings bore a secondary accent. A further objection is that
although the syllables which, according to Luick’s theory, are supposed
to bear a secondary accent are of course usually preceded by a long
root-syllable, it not unfrequently happens that a disyllabic word with
long root-syllable rhymes with one having a short root-syllable, in
which case the ending is not suited to bear a secondary accent at all,
e.g. <em>flúȝen: únnifṓge</em> 14043&ndash;4, <em>to-fóren: grḗten</em> 14071&ndash;2,
<em>sǣ́res: wólde</em> 14215&ndash;16, <em>fáreð: iuḗren</em> 14335&ndash;6, <em>icúmen:
Þréoien</em> 14337&ndash;8, <em>lágen</em> (=<em>laws</em>)<em>: lónde</em> 14339&ndash;40, <em>húnden: lúuien</em>
14480&ndash;1, <em>scóme: sṓne</em> 14604&ndash;5, <em>cúmen: hálden</em> 14612&ndash;13, <em>scípe:
brṓhte</em> 14862&ndash;3, <em>fáder: unrǣ́des</em> 14832&ndash;3, <em>fáder: rǣ́des</em>
14910&ndash;11, <em>fṓten: biscópen</em> 14821&ndash;2, <em>iwī́ten: scipen</em> 14251&ndash;2,
<em>wī́ten: wenden</em> 15060&ndash;1, <em>gúme: bisī́den</em> 15224&ndash;5, <em>fréondscìpe:
séoluen</em> 15226&ndash;7, <em>wúde: wéien-lǣ́len</em> 15508&ndash;9, <em>ibóren: béarne</em>
15670&ndash;1, <em>biȝáte: wéorlde-rī́che</em> 15732&ndash;3, <em>scáðe: fólke</em>
15784&ndash;5, <em>biswíken</em> (pret. pl.): <em>cráften</em> 29016&ndash;17, <em>aȝíuen:
ȝélden</em> 29052&ndash;3, <em>biuóren: fū̀sen</em> 29114&ndash;15, <em>súne: pḗode</em>
29175&ndash;6, <em>idríuen: kínerī́chen</em> 29177&ndash;18, <em>grúpen</em> (pret. pl.):
<em>mū̀ȝen</em> 29279&ndash;80, <em>stúden</em> (=<em>places</em>)<em>: bérnen</em> 29285&ndash;6, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The only cases in which a secondary accent seems to be required for an
unaccented final syllable are such rhymes as the <a class="pagenum" name="Pg_74" id="Pg_74" title="74"></a>following:&mdash;<em>hálì: forþí</em> 13915&ndash;16 (cf. <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Altengl. Metrik</cite>, p. 160); <em>men: cómèn</em>
13997&ndash;8 (MS. B: <em>men: here</em>), <em>men: dédèn</em> 13975&ndash;6, <em>isómned wés: lóndès</em>
25390&ndash;1, and so forth.<a class="fnanchor" name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100">[100]</a> But rhymes of this kind are in
comparison to the ordinary disyllabic or feminine endings so very rare
(occurring, for the most part, in lines which admit of a purely
alliterative scansion, or which have come down to us in an incorrect
state), that they have no bearing on the general rhythmic accentuation
of those final syllables, or on the rhythmic character of Layamon’s
verses in general (cf. p. 78, end of § 47).</p>

<p><a name="section46" id="section46"></a>
§ <b>46. Analysis of verse-types.</b> In turning now to a closer examination
of the rhythmic structure of the metre in Layamon’s <cite>Brut</cite> and in the
somewhat earlier <cite>Proverbs of Alfred</cite>, we are glad to find ourselves
more nearly than hitherto (though still not altogether) in agreement
with the views of Prof. Luick.</p>

<p>It is no small merit of his to have shown for the first time that the
five types of rhythmic forms pointed out by Sievers as existing in the
alliterative line are met with also in each of the four forms of verse
of Layamon’s <cite>Brut</cite> and of the <cite>Proverbs</cite>. And here it is of interest
to note that not only are the normal types of frequent occurrence
(chiefly in the <cite>Proverbs</cite>), but the extended types also, especially
in Layamon’s <cite>Brut</cite>, are met with even more frequently.</p>

<p>On account of our limited space only a few examples of each of the five
types can be given in this handbook.</p>

<p>Instead of quoting hemistichs or isolated short lines as examples of
each of the single types A, B, C, D, E, we prefer always to cite two
connected short lines, and to designate the rhythmic character of the
long line thus originating by the types of the two hemistichs, as
follows: A + A, A* + B, B* + C, C* + E, &amp;c., where A*, B*, C* signify
the extended types, to be discussed more fully below, and A, B, C, &amp;c.,
the normal types. This mode of treatment is necessary in order that our
examples may adequately represent the structure of the verse. The short
lines are always connected&mdash;either by alliteration, by rhyme (or
assonance), or by both combined, or sometimes merely by identity of
rhythm&mdash;into pairs. These pairs of short lines are regarded by Luick as
even-measured couplets, while we regard them as alliterative long lines;
but on either view each of them forms a coherent unity. We believe that
an examination of the couplet or long line as an undivided whole<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_75" id="Pg_75" title="75"></a> will
show unmistakably that the assumption of the even-measured character
of Layamon’s verse is erroneous, or at least that it applies only in
certain cases, when the metre is strongly influenced by Romanic
principles of versification. The examples are for the most part the same
as those which Prof. Luick has quoted,<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> but we have in all cases
added the complementary hemistichs, which are generally of somewhat
greater length:</p>

<p>A + A: <em>Ich <b>h</b>átte <b>H</b>éngest, | <b>H</b>órs is my bróðer.</em>
                                                           Lay. 13847&ndash;8.</p>

<p>D + *A: <em>for nys no <b>w</b>rt <b>u</b>éxynde | a <b>w</b>úde ne a <b>w</b>élde.</em>
                                                         Prov. x. 168&ndash;9.</p>

<p>A*+ D: <em>þat <b>é</b>uer mvwe þas <b>f</b>éye | <b>f</b>úrþ <b>ý</b>p-holde.</em>   ib. 170&ndash;1.</p>


<p>It is easy to observe that it is only when two identical types, like
A + A, C + C, E + E, are combined, that an even-beat rhythm (to some
extent at least) can be recognized; in all the other combinations this
character is entirely absent.</p>

<p><a name="section47" id="section47"></a>
§ <b>47. Extended types.</b> We now turn to the more numerous class of such
couplets or long lines which in both their component hemistichs exhibit
extended variations of the five types, resulting from anacrusis or from
the insertion of unstressed syllables in the interior of the line. These
verses, it is true, are somewhat more homogeneous, and have a certain
resemblance to an even-beat rhythm in consequence of the greater number
of un<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_76" id="Pg_76" title="76"></a>accented syllables, one of which (rarely two or more) may, under
the influence of the even-beat metre of the Norman-French original, have
been meant by the poet to be read with a somewhat stronger accentuation.
We are convinced, however, that in feminine endings, in so far as these
are formed, which is usually the case, by the unaccented endings <em>-e</em>,
<em>-en</em>, <em>-es</em>, <ins class="correction" title="original: eþ"><em>-eþ</em></ins><a name="CORR_2" id="CORR_2"></a>, &amp;c., these final syllables never, or at most only in
isolated cases, which do not affect the general character of the rhythm,
have a stronger accent or, as Prof. Luick thinks, form a secondary
arsis. As little do we admit the likelihood of such a rhythmic
accentuation of these syllables when they occur in the middle of the
line, generally of such lines as belong to the normal types mentioned
above.</p>

<p>It is convenient, however, to adopt Luick’s formulas for these common
forms of Layamon’s verse, with this necessary modification, that we
discard the secondary accent attributed by him to the last syllable of
the types A, C, D, accepting only his types B and E without any change.
We therefore regard the normally constructed short lines of Layamon’s
metre&mdash;so far as they are not purely alliterative lines of two accents,
but coupled together by rhyme or assonance, or by alliteration and rhyme
combined&mdash;as belonging to one or other of the following two classes:
(1) lines with four accents and masculine or monosyllabic endings (types
B and E); and (2) lines of three accents and feminine or disyllabic
endings (types A, C, D). In this classification those unaccented
syllables which receive a secondary stress are, for the sake of brevity,
treated as full stresses&mdash;which, indeed, they actually came to be in the
later development of the metre, and possibly to some extent even in
Layamon’s own verse.</p>

<p>Assuming the correctness of this view, the chief types of Layamon’s
verse may be expressed by the following formulas, in which the bracketed
theses are to be considered optional:</p>

<div class="column-container">
  <div class="column">
    <div>Type A: <span class="scansion">(×)–́(×)×̀×–́×</span>.</div>
    <div>Type C: <span class="scansion">(×)×̀×–́–́×</span>.</div>
    <div>Type E: <span class="scansion"> ×–́(×)×̀××̀×–́</span>.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <div>Type B: <span class="scansion">(×)×̀×–́(×)×̀× –́</span>.</div>
    <div>Type D: <span class="scansion">(×)–́×–́×̀×</span>.</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>As these types may be varied by resolutions in the same way as the
primary types, there arise various additional formulas such as the
following:</p>

<div class="column-container">
  <div class="column">
    <div>A: <span class="scansion">(×)⏑́×(×)×–́×</span>.</div>
    <div>C: <span class="scansion">(×)×̀×⏑́×–́×</span>, &amp;c.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <div>B: <span class="scansion">(×)×̀×–́(×)×̀×⏑́×</span>.</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Other variations may be effected by disyllabic or even poly<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_77" id="Pg_77" title="77"></a>syllabic
theses in the beginning (‘anacruses’) or in the middle of the verse
instead of monosyllabic theses.</p>

<p>Apart from these another frequently occurring variation of type C must
be mentioned which corresponds to the formula <span class="scansion">(×)×̀×–́×–́×</span>, and may
be designated (with Professors Paul and Luick) as type C<sup>a</sup>, because the
position of its accented syllables points to type C, while on the other
hand it bears a certain resemblance to type A.</p>

<p>The following examples, many of which have been quoted before by Luick,
may serve to illustrate these types of short lines or rather hemistichs
and their combination in couplets or long lines, in which a normal
hemistich is often followed by a lengthened one and vice versa:</p>

<p>The first hemistich of the last line offers a specimen of a variation
of the ordinary types with feminine endings (chiefly of A, C, and
C<sup>a</sup>), designated by Prof. Luick as A<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>1</sub>, C<sup>a</sup><sub>1</sub>, and showing the
peculiarity that instead of the ending <span class="scansion">–́×</span> somewhat fuller forms occur,
consisting either of two separate words or of a compound word, and
thus corresponding either to the formula <span class="scansion">–́×̀</span>, or, if there are three
syllables, to the formula <span class="scansion">–́××̀</span>, or in case of a resolution (as in the
above example) to the formula <span class="scansion">–́×⏑́×</span>. We differ from Prof. Luick,
however, in admitting also endings corresponding to the formula <span class="scansion">⏑́×̀×</span>.</p>

<p>As a rule, if not always, such forms of verse are occasioned by the
requirements of rhyme. This is not the case, it is true, in the
following purely alliterative line:</p>

<div class="iline"><span class="normal">A<sub>1</sub>* + A*:</span> þe kíng sòne úp stòd | and sétte hine bì him séoluen.</div>
<div class="attribution">Lay. 14073&ndash;4.</div>

<p>but in other verses it is so, e.g.:</p>

<div class="iline"><span class="normal">B* + A<sub>1</sub>*:</span> Ah of éou ich wùlle iwíten | þurh sóðen èouwer wúrðscìpen.</div>
<div class="attribution">ib. 13835&ndash;6.</div>

<p>and similarly (not corresponding to <span class="scansion">–́××̀</span>, as Prof. Luick thinks):</p>

<div class="iline"><span class="normal">A<sub>1</sub>* + B*:</span> bìdden us to fúltúme | þàt is Críst gòdes súne.</div>
<div class="attribution">ib. 14618&ndash;19.</div>

<p>but the formula <span class="scansion">–́××̀</span>is represented by the following verses:</p>

<div class="iline"><span class="normal">A<sub>1</sub>* + A<sub>1</sub>*:</span> þe <b>þ</b>únre heo ȝìven <b>þ</b>únresdǽi | for<b>þ</b>í þat
             hèo heom helpen mæ̀i.</div>
<div class="attribution">ib. 13929&ndash;30.</div>

<div class="iline"><span class="normal">A<sub>1</sub>* + A<sub>1</sub>*:</span> þe <b>éo</b>rl ànd þe <b>é</b>þelỳng | ib<b>ú</b>reþ ùnder gódne
              kìng.</div>
<div class="attribution">Prov. iv. 74&ndash;5.</div>

<div class="iline"><span class="normal">C<sub>1</sub>* + C<sup>a</sup><sub>1</sub>*:</span> nès þer nán crístindòm, | þèr þe kíng þat máide nòm.</div>
<div class="attribution">Lay. 14387&ndash;8.</div>

<p>In the last but one of these examples this accentuation is corroborated
in the Jesus College MS. by the written accent on the word <em>gódne</em>,
whereby not only the rhyme <em>-lyng: king</em> is shown to be an unaccented
one, but at the same time the two-beat rhythm of the hemistich is proved
as well as that of the preceding hemistich. Moreover, the alliteration
in all these examples is a further proof of the two-beat character of
their rhythm.</p>

<p><a name="section48" id="section48"></a>
§ <b>48.</b> It was owing to the use of these two more strongly accented
syllables in each verse which predominate over the other syllables,
whether with secondary accents or unaccented, that the<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_79" id="Pg_79" title="79"></a> poets, who wrote
in this metre, found it possible to regard the different kinds of verse
they employed as rhythmically equivalent. These were as follows: (1)
purely alliterative lines with hemistichs of two stresses, (2) extended
lines of this kind with secondary accents in the middle of the
hemistich, (3) rhyming-alliterative or merely rhyming lines with a
feminine ending and a secondary accent in the middle of the verse, or
with a masculine ending and two secondary accents, one on the last
syllable, as is also the case with the corresponding verses mentioned
under the second heading. These two last-mentioned verse-forms are very
similar to two popular metres formed on the model of Romanic metres. The
former of them&mdash;the hemistich with three stresses (one of which is
secondary) and feminine ending, together with the much rarer variety
that has a masculine ending&mdash;resembles the sections of the Alexandrine;
and the hemistich with a masculine ending (more rarely a feminine) and
four stresses (two of which have secondary accents only) is similar to
the short four-beat couplet, and also to the first section of the
Septenary line (the second section being similar to the former
three-beat group). It is, therefore, not to be wondered at that this
metre of Layamon in its different forms (that of the purely alliterative
line included) is in several Middle English poems, chiefly in <cite>The
Bestiary</cite>, employed concurrently (both in separate passages and in the
same passage) with the above-mentioned foreign metres formed on Romanic
or mediaeval-Latin models. By this fact the influence of the Romanic
versification on the origin and development of this form of the native
verse gains increased <span class="locked">probability.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>The limits of our space do not permit of further discussion of this
peculiar metre, which, as presented in the extant examples, appears
rather as in process of development than as a finished product, and of
which a complete understanding can be attained only by elaborate
statistical investigation.</p>


<h4>C. The progressive form of the alliterative line,
     rhymed throughout. ‘King Horn.’</h4>

<p><a name="section49" id="section49"></a>
§ <b>49.</b> The further development of the Layamon-verse is very simple and
such as might naturally be expected from its previous history.</p>

<p>The use of final rhyme becomes constant, and consequently<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_80" id="Pg_80" title="80"></a> alliteration,
although remnants of it still are noticeable even in short lines
connected together, becomes more and more <span class="locked">scarce.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The unaccented syllables are interposed between the accented ones with
greater regularity; and among the unaccented syllables the one (or,
in some sub-species of the verse, more than one) which is relatively
stronger than the rest receives full metrical stress, or at least nearly
approaches the fully-stressed syllables in rhythmical value.</p>

<p>This form of the metre is represented by a short poem<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> consisting
of only twelve lines, belonging to the first half of the thirteenth
century, and by the well-known poem <cite>King Horn</cite><a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> (1530 lines) which
belongs to the middle of the same century.</p>

<p>The prevailing rhythmical form of this poem is exemplified by the
following verses, which for the sake of convenience we print here, not
in the form of couplets (as the editors, quite justifiably, have done),
but in that of long lines as they are written in the Harleian MS.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Hórn þu àrt wel kéne | and þat is wèl iséne. <span class="attrib">91&ndash;2.</span></div>
    <div class="line">Þe sé bigàn to flówe | and Hórn chìld to rówe. <span class="attrib">117&ndash;18.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This form occurs in more than 1300 out of the 1530 short lines of which
the poem consists. It is evident that the rhythm of these lines is
nearly the same as in the following taken from earlier poems:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">ǣ́fre embe stúnde | he séalde sume wúnde. <span class="attrib">Byrhtn. 271.</span></div>
    <div class="line">ínnon þām gemónge | on ǣ́nlicum wónge. <span class="attrib">Dom. 6.</span></div>
    <div class="line">súme hi man bénde | súme hi man blénde. <span class="attrib">Chron. 1036. 4.</span></div>
    <div class="line">þát he nam be wíhte | and mid mýcelan unríhte. <span class="attrib">ib. 1087. 4.</span></div>
    <div class="line">wiþ póuere and wiþ ríche | wiþ álle monne ilýche. <span class="attrib">Prov. 375&ndash;6.</span></div>
    <div class="line">ne míhte we bilǽve | for líve ne for dǽþe. <span class="attrib">Lay. 13875&ndash;6.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>If those syllables which have the strongest accent in the unaccented
parts of these verses are uttered a little more loudly than was usual
in the alliterative line the rhythm becomes exactly the same as in the
corresponding verses of King Horn, where the three-beat rhythm already
has become the rule.</p>

<p>This rule, however, is by no means without exceptions, and even the old
two-beat rhythm (which may have been the original<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_81" id="Pg_81" title="81"></a> rhythm) is, in the
oldest form of the poem, sometimes clearly perceptible, rarely, it is
true, in both hemistichs, as e.g. in the following line:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Hi slóȝen and fúȝten | þe níȝt and þe úȝten. <span class="attrib">1375&ndash;6,</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>but somewhat oftener in one of them, as in the following:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Hi wénden to wísse | of hère líf to mísse. <span class="attrib">121&ndash;2.</span></div>
    <div class="line">So schál þi náme sprínge | from kínge to kínge. <span class="attrib">211&ndash;12.</span></div>
    <div class="line">In Hórnes ilíke | þú schalt hùre beswíke. <span class="attrib">289&ndash;90.</span></div>
    <div class="line">Hi rúnge þe bélle | þe wédlak fòr to felle. <span class="attrib">1253&ndash;4.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Of this type of verse a great many examples are of course to be met
with in the earlier alliterative poems:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">wúldres wédde | wī́tum āspḗdde. <span class="attrib">An. 1633.</span></div>

    <div class="line">bivóren þan kínge | fáirest àlre þínge. <span class="attrib">Lay. 14303&ndash;4.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The third type (three beats with masculine ending), which is of rarer
occurrence, is represented by the following lines:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Þú art grèt and stróng, | fáir and èuene lóng. <span class="attrib">93&ndash;4.</span></div>

    <div class="line">Léue at hìre he nám | and into hálle cám. <span class="attrib">585&ndash;6.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The fourth type (four beats with masculine ending), which occurs
somewhat oftener, has the following form:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Ófte hàdde Hòrn beo wó, | ac nèure wúrs þan hìm was þó. <span class="attrib">115&ndash;16.</span></div>
    <div class="line">Þe stúard wàs in hèrte wó, | fòr he núste whàt to dó. <span class="attrib">275&ndash;6.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_82" id="Pg_82" title="82"></a></p>

<p>The corresponding rhythm of the earlier poems occurs in verses like:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">and his gefḗran he fordrā́f, | and sume míslice of slṓh. <span class="attrib">Chr. 1036. 2.</span></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The fifth type (four beats with feminine endings) is represented
by the following verses:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">To déþe hè hem álle bròȝte, | his fáder dèþ wel dére hi bòȝte. <span class="attrib">883&ndash;4.</span></div>
    <div class="line">Tomóreȝe bè þe fíȝtinge, | whàne þe líȝt of dáye sprìnge. <span class="attrib">817&ndash;18.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>As corresponding verses of earlier poems we quote:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>s</b>úme hi man wiþ fḗo <b>s</b>éalde, | <b>s</b>úme hrēowlice ācwéalde. <span class="attrib">Chron. 1036. 3.</span></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The circumstance that these different types of verse occur in different
poems promiscuously makes it evident that they must all have been
developed from one original rhythmical form. It is clear that this
fundamental type can only be found in the old two-beat alliterative
hemistich, the more so as this kind of verse is the very metre in which
the earlier poems <cite>Byrhtnoth</cite> and <cite>Be Dōmes Dæge</cite> for the greatest part
are written, and which is exemplified in about a third part of the
poetical piece of the <cite>Saxon Chronicle</cite> of 1036 and a fifth part of the
later-piece of 1087, and again very frequently in <cite>Alfred’s Proverbs</cite>
and in Layamon’s <cite>Brut</cite>, and which still can be traced as the original
rhythm of <cite>King Horn</cite></p>

<p><a name="section50" id="section50"></a>
§ <b>50.</b> The evidence of the metre of this poem, showing its affinity to
the alliterative line and its historical origin from it, is so cogent
that it is unnecessary to discuss the theories of Prof. Trautmann and
the late Dr. Wissmann, both of whom, although from different points of
view, agree in ascribing a four-beat rhythm to this <span class="locked">metre.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></span></p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_83" id="Pg_83" title="83"></a></p>

<p>The frequent use again in this poem of the types of line occurring in
Layamon’s <cite>Brut</cite>, as pointed out by Prof. Luick (l. c.), puts the close
connexion of the metre of <cite>King Horn</cite> with that form of the alliterative
line beyond doubt. We cannot, however, in conformity with the view we
have taken of Layamon’s verse, agree with Prof. Luick in assigning a
secondary accent to the last syllable of the feminine ending of the
ordinary three-beat verse, in which the greater part of <cite>King Horn</cite> is
written. Prof. Luick himself does not insist upon that particular point
so strongly for this poem as he did for the earlier poems written in a
similar metre.</p>

<p>The following examples serve to show that the same extended types of
line which were found to be the commonest in Layamon’s <cite>Brut</cite> (cp.
p. 77) recur as the most usual types also in this poem:</p>

<p>A + C: <em>Álle bèon he blíþe | þat tò my sóng lýþe!</em>                1&ndash;2.</p>

<p>A + A: <em>A sáng ihc schàl ȝou sínge | of Múrrȳ̀ þè kínge.</em>    2&ndash;3.</p>

<p>A + A: <em>He fónd bì þe strónde, | aríued òn his lónde</em>,           35&ndash;6.</p>

<p>B + C: <em>Àll þe dáy and àl þe nī́ȝt, | tìl hit spráng dái lìȝt.</em> 123&ndash;4.</p>

<p>B + B: <em>Fàirer nis nón þàne he wás, | hè was bríȝt sò þe glás.</em>   13&ndash;14.</p>

<p>C + C: <em>Bì þe sé síde, | ase hè was, wóned (<span class="scansion">⏑́×</span>) ríde.</em>         33&ndash;4.</p>

<p>C + A: <em>Of þìne méstére, | of wúde and òf rivére.</em>             229&ndash;30.</p>

<p>D + A: <em>Schípes fíftène | with sárazìn[e]s kéne.</em>                37&ndash;8.</p>

<p>C + A: <em>Þe chìld him ánswérde, | sóne so hè hit hérde.</em>       199&ndash;200.</p>

<p>B + E: <em>Hè was whít sò þe flúr, | róse-rèd was hìs colúr.</em>      15&ndash;16.</p>

<p>In most cases we see that identical or similar types of verse are
connected here so as to form a couplet (printed by us as one long line).
Even where this is not so, however, the two chief accents in each short
line serve to make all the different forms and types of verse occurring
in this poem sound homogeneous. This admits of a ready explanation,
as the poem, in which no stanzaic arrangement can be detected, although
styled a ‘song’ (line 2), was certainly never meant to be sung to a
regular tune. On the contrary, it was undoubtedly recited like the
‘Song’ of Beowulf&mdash;probably not without a proper musical
accompaniment&mdash;by the minstrels.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_84" id="Pg_84" title="84"></a></p>

<p>At all events the treatment of the words with regard to their rhythmic
use in this poem does not deviate from that of Layamon.</p>

<p><a name="section51" id="section51"></a>
§ <b>51.</b> The two poems are of the same period, and in both the
etymological and syntactical accentuation of natural speech forms the
basis of the rhythmic accentuation. Monosyllabic words and the accented
syllables of polysyllabic words having a strong syntactical accent are
placed in the arsis; unaccented inflectional syllables as a rule form
the theses of a verse; second parts of compounds and fully sounding
derivative syllables are commonly used for theses with a somewhat
stronger accent, and may, if placed in the arsis, even bear the
alliteration, or, if they are less strongly accented, the rhyme:</p>

<p>Unaccented inflexional syllables as a rule stand in the thesis of a
verse. Only in exceptional cases, which admit of a different explanation
(see above, pp. 74 and 76), they may bear the rhythmical accent if the
rhyme demands it.</p>

<p>That a thesis in Layamon’s <cite>Brut</cite> and in <cite>Alfred’s Proverbs</cite> may be
disyllabic or even trisyllabic both in the beginning and the middle of a
line is evident from the many examples quoted above.</p>

<p>In <em>King Horn</em>, where the division of the original long lines into two
short ones has been carried out completely, and where the rhythm of the
verse has consequently become more regular, the thesis, if not wanting
entirely, as usually the case, in the types C, D, E, is generally
monosyllabic. But, as the following examples, <em>faírer ne mìȝte</em> 8, <em>þe
paíns còme to lónde</em> 58, <em>þanne schólde withùten óþe</em> 347, will show,
disyllabic theses do also occur, both after the first and second arsis,
and in the beginning of the line.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="subtitle">THE ALLITERATIVE LINE IN ITS CONSERVATIVE<br />
  FORM DURING THE FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH CENTURIES</span></h3>


<h4>A. The alliterative verse without rhyme.</h4>

<p><a name="section52" id="section52"></a>
§ <b>52.</b> The progressive or free form of the alliterative line came to an
end as early as the middle of the thirteenth century, when it broke up
into short rhyming couplets. The stricter form was for nearly three
centuries longer a very popular metre in English poetry, especially in
the North-Western and Northern districts of England and in the adjacent
lowlands of Scotland. The first traces, however, of its existence after
the Norman Conquest are to be found in the South of England, where some
poetical homilies and lives of saints were written at the end of the
twelfth and in the beginning of the thirteenth century which are of the
same character, both as to their subjects and to their metre, as the
poetical paraphrases and homilies written by Ælfric. These poems are
<cite>Hali Meidenhad</cite> (a poetical homily), the legends of <cite>St. Marharete</cite>,
<cite>St. Juliana</cite>, and <cite>St. Katherine</cite>. These poems have been edited for
the Early English Text Society, Nos. 18, 13, 51, 80; the first three
by Cockayne as prose-texts, the last by Dr. Einenkel, who printed it in
short couplets regarded by him as having the same four-beat rhythm
(Otfrid’s metre) which he and his teacher, Prof. Trautmann, suppose to
exist in Layamon and <cite>King Horn</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The Homilies have no rhymes.</p>

<p>The form of these homilies and legends occasionally exhibits real
alliterative lines, but for the most part is nothing but rhythmical
prose, altogether too irregular to call for an investigation<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_86" id="Pg_86" title="86"></a> here.
Some remarks on passages written in a form more or less resembling
alliterative verse may be found in our <cite>Englische Metrik</cite>, vol. i, § 94.</p>

<p>It is quite out of the question to suppose these Southern works, with
their very irregular use of alliteration and metre, to have had any
influence on the metrical form of the very numerous alliterative poems
written in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in the Midland and
Northern districts of England. It is, however, not at all likely that
alliterative poetry should have sprung up there without any medium of
tradition, and that it should have returned to the strict forms of the
Old English models. Nor can we assume that it was handed down by means
of oral tradition only on the part of the minstrels from Old English
times down to the fourteenth century. The channel of tradition of the
genuine alliterative line must be sought for in documents which for the
most part have been lost.</p>

<p>A few small remnants, however, have been preserved, viz. a charm in a
MS. of the twelfth century (cf. Zupitza, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitschrift für deutsches
Altertum</cite>, xxxi. 49), a short poem, entitled ‘Ten Abuses’, belonging
to the same period (E. E. T. S. 49, p. 184), a prophecy of five lines
contained in the chronicle of Benedict of Peterborough (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rerum
Britannicarum Scriptores</cite>, 49, ii. 139), finally a prophecy ascribed
to Thomas of Erceldoune (E.E. T. S., vol. 61, xviii, <cite>Thom. of Erc.</cite>,
ed. by A. Brandl, p. 26). But these pieces, treated by Prof. Luick in
Paul’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Grundriss</cite>, ed. 2, II. ii, p. 160, are either too short or
are too uncertain in text to admit of our making definite conclusions
from them.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_87" id="Pg_87" title="87"></a></p>

<p>But from the middle of the fourteenth century onward we have a large
number of poems composed in regular alliterative verse, e.g.  <cite>King
Alisaunder</cite> (Als.) and <cite>William of Palerne</cite> (W.), both in E. E. T. S.,
Extra-Ser. No. 1; <cite>Joseph of Arimathie</cite> (J.A.), E. E.T. S. 44; <cite>Sir
Gawain and the Green Knight</cite> (Gr.), E.E. T. S. 4; <cite>Piers Plowman</cite>
(P. P.), by W. Langland, E. E. T. S., Nos. 17, 28, 30, 38, 54; <cite>Pierce
the Plowman’s Crede</cite> (P. P. Cr.), E. E. T. S. 30; <cite>Richard the Redeles</cite>
(R. R.), E. E. T. S. 54; <cite>The Crowned King</cite> (Cr. K.), ibid.; <cite>The
Destruction of Troy</cite>, E. E.T. S. 39, 56; <cite>Morte Arthure</cite>, E. E. T. S. 8;
<cite>Cleanness</cite> and <cite>Patience</cite>, E. E. T. S. 1; <cite>The Chevalere Assigne</cite>,
E. E.T. S., Extra-Ser. 6; and others of the end of the fifteenth and the
beginning of the sixteenth centuries: see Prof. W. W. Skeat’s list in
‘Bishop Percy’s Folio MS.’, London, 1867 (ed. Furnivall and Hales), vol.
iii, p. xi, and many recent publications of the Early English Text
Society.</p>

<p>On the <b>structure of this metre</b> the opinions of scholars differ a good
deal less than on that of the progressive or free form of the
alliterative line. Yet there are a few adherents of the four-beat theory
who apply it to the alliterative line of this epoch, amongst others
Rosenthal (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘Die alliterierende englische Langzeile im 14. Jahrhundert,’</span>
<cite>Anglia</cite>, i. 414 ff.). The two-beat theory, on the other hand, has been
upheld also for this form of the alliterative line by Prof. W. W. Skeat,
<cite>Essay on Alliterative Poetry</cite>, Percy Folio MS. 1867 (ed. Furnivall and
Hales), by the present writer in <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Englische Metrik</cite>, i, pp. 195&ndash;212, and
by Prof. Luick, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Anglia</cite>, xi, pp. 392&ndash;443 and 553&ndash;618, and subsequently
in Paul’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Grundriss</cite>, ed. 2, II. ii, pp. 161&ndash;3.</p>

<p><a name="section53" id="section53"></a>
§ <b>53. The use and treatment of the words in the verse</b> is on the
whole the same as in the Old English period. The chief divergence is,
that in this period of the language the difference between long and
short syllables was lost, in consequence of the lengthening of short
vowels in open syllables which had taken place in the interval, and
that consequently the substitution of a short accented syllable and
an unaccented one for a long accented syllable (the so-called
resolution) was no longer admissible. Otherwise syllables with a primary
accent, syllables with a secondary accent, and unaccented syllables are
treated just as in the Old English poetry. Accented syllables are as
a rule placed in the arsis, as are also second parts of compounds. Other
syllables with secondary accent (derivative and inflectional syllables)
are only in exceptional cases placed in the arsis of a verse.</p>

<p>It is of special interest, however, to notice that words of Romanic
origin which in the course of time had been introduced into the language
are in many cases accented according to Germanic usage. Words of which
the last syllable was accented in French have in their Middle-English
form the chief accent thrown on a preceding, frequently on the first,
syllable, and in consequence of this the originally fully accented
syllable in trisyllabic words receives the secondary accent and is
treated in the rhythm of the verse in the same way as syllables with
a secondary accent in English words. The laws, too, which in Old English
affect the subordination and position of the parts of speech in their
relationship to the rhythm of the verse and to the alliteration, remain,
generally speaking, in force. It is remarkable that ‘if an attributive
adjective is joined to a substantive, and a verb to a prepositional
adverb, the first part of these groups of words still has the chief
accent’ (Luick). The<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_88" id="Pg_88" title="88"></a> relationship, on the other hand, of verse and
sentence is changed. While in Old English poetry run-on-lines were
very popular and new sentences therefore frequently began in the
middle of a line, after the caesura, we find that in Middle English, as
a rule, the end of the sentence coincides with the end of the line.
Hence every line forms a unity by itself, and the chief pause falls at
the end, not, as was frequently the case in Old English times, after the
caesura.</p>

<p><a name="section54" id="section54"></a>
§ <b>54. Alliteration.</b> On the whole, the same laws regarding the
position of the alliterative sounds are still in force as before; it is
indeed remarkable that they are sometimes even more strictly observed.
In the <cite>Destruction of Troy</cite>, e.g. triple alliteration according to the
formula <em>a a a x</em> is employed throughout.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Now of <b>T</b>róy forto <b>t</b>élle | is myn en<b>t</b>ént euyn,</div>
    <div class="line">Of the <b>st</b>óure and þe <b>st</b>rýfe, | when it di<b>st</b>róyet wás.</div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="attribution">Prol. 27&ndash;8.</div>

<p>Alongside of this order of alliteration we find in most of the other
poems the other schemes of alliteration popular in Old English times,
e.g.  <em>a x a x, x a a x, a b a b, a b b a</em>:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">In þe <b>f</b>órmest yére, | that he <b>f</b>írst réigned. <span class="attrib">Als. 40.</span></div>
    <div class="line">Þénne gonne I <b>m</b>éeten | a <b>m</b>érvelous svévene.<span class="attrib">P. P. Prol. 11.</span></div>
    <div class="line">I had <b>m</b>índe on my <b>s</b>lépe | by <b>m</b>éting of <b>s</b>wéuen.<span class="attrib">Als. 969.</span></div>
    <div class="line">And <b>f</b>ónd as þe <b>m</b>éssageres | hade <b>m</b>únged be<b>f</b>óre.<span class="attrib">W. 4847.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Irregularities, however, in the position of the alliteration are
frequently met with, e.g. parallel alliteration: <em>a a, b b</em>:</p>

<div class="iline">What þis <b>m</b>óuntein be<b>m</b>éneþ | and þis <b>d</b>érke <b>d</b>ále. <span class="attrib">P. P. i. 1;</span></div>

<p>or the chief alliterative sound (the ‘head-stave’) may be placed in the
last accented syllable (<em>a a x a</em>):</p>

<div class="iline">‘Now be <b>C</b>ríst,’ quod the <b>k</b>íng, | ‘ȝif I míhte <b>c</b>hácche. <span class="attrib">ib. ii. 167;</span></div>

<p>or it may be wanting entirely, especially in <cite>William of Palerne</cite>:</p>

<div class="iline">Sche <b>k</b>ólled it ful <b>k</b>índly | and áskes is náme. <span class="attrib">W. 69;</span></div>

<p>and there are even found a certain number of verses without any
alliteration at all in <cite>Joseph of Arimathie</cite>:</p>

<div class="iline">Whan Jóseph hérde þer-of, | he bád hem not demáyȝen. <span class="attrib"><ins class="correction" title="original: J. A. 31">J. A. 31.</ins><a name="CORR_3" id="CORR_3"></a></span></div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_89" id="Pg_89" title="89"></a></p>

<p>In such cases it may sometimes be noticed that a line which has no
internal alliteration is linked by alliteration with a preceding or with
a following line, in the same way as was to be observed already in the
last century of the Old English period (cf. p. 50):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Bot on the <b>C</b>ristynmes dáye, | whene they were álle <b>s</b>émblyde,</div>
    <div class="line">That <b>c</b>ómliche <b>c</b>ónquerour | <b>c</b>ómmaundez hym <b>s</b>elvyne.</div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="attribution">Morte Arth. 70&ndash;1.</div>

<p>Again an excess of alliteration is found, which happens in different
ways, either by admitting four alliterative sounds in one line
(<em>a a a a</em>) as was sometimes done even in Old English:</p>

<div class="iline">In a <b>s</b>ómer <b>s</b>éson | when <b>s</b>ófte was þe <b>s</b>ónne. <span class="attrib">P. P. Prol. 1;</span></div>

<p>or by retaining the same alliterative sound in several consecutive
lines, e.g. :</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
     <div class="line">þenne was <b>C</b>ónscience i<b>c</b>léþet | to <b>c</b>ómen and apéeren</div>
     <div class="line">tofore the <b>k</b>ýng and his <b>c</b>óunsel, | <b>c</b>lérkes and óþure.</div>
     <div class="line"><b>k</b>néolynge <b>C</b>ónscience | to the <b>k</b>ýng lóutede.</div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="attribution">ib. iii. 109&ndash;11;</div>

<p>or, finally, by allowing the somewhat more strongly accented syllables
of the theses to participate in the alliteration:</p>

<div class="iline">and was a <b>b</b>íg <b>b</b>old <b>b</b>árn | and <b>b</b>réme of his áge. <span class="attrib">W. 18.</span></div>

<p>By the increasing use of this kind of alliteration it ultimately
degenerated so much that the real nature of it was completely forgotten.
This is evident from the general advice which King James VI gives in his
<cite>Revlis and Cavtelis to be observit and eschewit in Scottis Poesie</cite>
(Arber’s Reprint, p. 63):</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>Let all your verse be <em>Literall</em>, sa far as may be, quhatsumeuer kynde
  they be of, but speciallie <em>Tumbling</em> verse [evidently the
  alliterative line] for flyting. Be <em>Literall</em> I meane, that the maist
  pairt of your lyne sall rynne vpon a letter, as this tumbling lyne
  rynnis vpon F.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Fetching fade for to feid it fast furth of the Farie</em><span class="locked">.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>He then gives a description of this kind of verse which makes it evident
that he looked upon ‘tumbling verse’ as a rhythm of two beats in each
hemistich or four beats in the full line, for he says:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Ȝe man observe that thir Tumbling verse flowis not on that fassoun
  as vtheris dois. For all vtheris keipis the reule quhilk I gave
  before, to wit<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_90" id="Pg_90" title="90"></a> the first fute short the secound lang and sa furth.
  Quhair as thir hes twa short and are lang throuch all the lyne quhen
  they keip ordour, albeit the maist pairt of thame be out of ordour
  and keipis na kynde nor reule of Flowing and for that cause are
  callit Tumbling verse.</p>
</div>

<p>King James VI was a contemporary of the last poets who wrote in
alliterative lines in the North and therefore undoubtedly had heard such
poems read by reciters who had kept up the true tradition of their
scansion. We have here then the very best proof we can desire not only
of the four-beat rhythm of the line, but also of the fact that
unaccented words, although they may alliterate intentionally, as they
do often in poems of the fifteenth century, or unintentionally, as
earlier, do not get a full accent in consequence of the alliteration, as
some scholars have thought, but remain unaccented.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>

As to the quality of the alliteration the same laws on the whole still
prevail as in Old English poetry, but are less strictly observed. Thus
frequently voiced and unvoiced sounds alliterate together, and the
aspiration is neglected; <em>f</em> alliterates with <em>v</em>, <em>v</em> with <em>w</em>, <em>w</em>
with <em>wh</em>, <em>s</em> with <em>sh</em> or with combinations of <em>s</em> and other
consonants, <em>g</em> with <em>k</em>, <em>h</em> with <em>ch</em>:</p>

<div class="lines-container">

  </div>
</div>

<p>On the other hand, sometimes (as e.g. in the <cite>Alisaunder</cite> fragments)
greater strictness may be noticed in regard to alliteration of vowels,
as only the same vowels<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> are allowed to alliterate:</p>

<div class="iline">wiþ þé <b>é</b>rldam of <b>É</b>nuye | <b>é</b>uer forto láste.<span class="attrib">P. P. ii. 63.</span></div>

<p>Later on, in the fifteenth century, vocalic alliteration in general
falls into disuse more and more.</p>

<p><a name="section55" id="section55"></a>
§ <b>55. Comparison of Middle English and Old English alliterative
verse.</b> With regard to the rhythmic structure of the verse the Middle
English alliterative line is not very different<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_91" id="Pg_91" title="91"></a> from the corresponding
Old English metre. Two beats in each hemistich are, of course, the
rule, and it has been shown by Dr. K. Luick, in a very valuable
paper on the English alliterative line in the fourteenth, fifteenth,
and sixteenth centuries,<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> that all the different types which
Prof. Sievers has discovered for the two sections of the Old English
alliterative line occur here again, but with certain modifications.</p>

<p>The modifications which the five chief types have undergone originated
in the tendency to simplify their many varieties exactly in the same way
as the Old English inflexional forms of the language were simplified and
generalized in the Middle English period.</p>

<p>Only three of the five old types, viz. those with an even number of
members (A, B, C), are preserved in the second section of the verse,
and those not in their original forms. They show further a certain
tendency to assimilate to each other.</p>

<p>In types B and C the variations with disyllabic anacrusis occurred most
frequently, as was also the case in type A, and verses of this kind now
become predominant. Furthermore, in the Old English alliterative line,
endings consisting of an accented and an unaccented syllable (feminine
endings) prevailed; and type B was the only one of the symmetrical
types ending with an accented syllable. In Middle English the use of
feminine endings goes so far that the original type B has disappeared
altogether and given place to a new type with an unaccented last
syllable corresponding to the form <span class="scansion">××–́×–́×</span>.</p>

<p>Prof. Luick very properly calls this type BC, holding that it
originated from the variations <span class="scansion">××–́×⏑́͜×</span> and <span class="scansion">××⏑́͜×–́×</span> of
the old types B and C in consequence of the lengthening of the
originally short accented syllable. Verse-ends with two unaccented
syllables, which might have arisen in the same way from <span class="scansion">–́×</span> = <span class="scansion">⏑́͜××</span>,
did not become popular; and verse-ends with one unaccented syllable
predominated. Lastly, an important feature of the later verse-technique
deserves notice, that a monosyllabic anacrusis (an initial unaccented
syllable) is generally allowed in types where it was not permitted in
the Old English alliterative line. The consequence of these changes
is that the rhythm of the verse which was in Old English a descending
rhythm, becomes in Middle English ascending, and is brought into line
with the rhythm of the contemporary even-beat metres.</p>

<p>This is the state of development presented by the Middle English
alliterative line in one of the earliest poems of this group, viz. in
the fragments of <cite>King Alisaunder</cite>, the versification of which, as a
rule, is very correct.</p>

<p>Here the three types only which we have mentioned occur in the second
hemistich.</p>

<p>Type A is most common, corresponding to the formula <span class="scansion">(×)–́××–́×</span>:</p>

<p><em><b>l</b>órdes and óoþer</em> 1, <em><b>d</b>éedes of ármes</em> 5, <em><b>k</b>íd in his tíme</em>
   11, <em><b>t</b>érme of his lífe</em> 16,</p>

<p>or with anacrusis:</p>

<p><em>or <b>st</b>érne was hólden</em> 10, <em>and <b>s</b>óne beráfter</em> 25.</p>

<p>More than two unaccented syllables may occur <em>after</em> the first accented
syllable. These two peculiarities seldom occur together in one and the
same second hemistich (though frequently in the first hemistich); but
there are some examples:</p>

<p><em>is <b>t</b>úrned too him álse</em> 165, <em>and <b>p</b>ríkeden abóute</em> 382, <em>hee
  <b>f</b>áred òn in háste</em> 79;</p>

<p>in this last example with a secondary accent on the word <em>òn</em> as
also in the verse: <em>þe <b>m</b>éssengères þei cámme</em> 1126.</p>

<p>Type C, <span class="scansion">(×)××–́–́×</span>:</p>

<p><em>was þe mán hóten</em> 13, <em>þat his <b>k</b>íth ásketh</em> 65, <em>as a <b>k</b>íng
  shólde</em> 17, <em>withoute <b>m</b>íscháunce</em> 1179.</p>

<p>Type BC, <span class="scansion">(×)××–́×–́×</span>:</p>

<p><em>or it <b>t</b>ýme wére</em> 30, <em>in his <b>f</b>áders life</em> 46, <em>of þis <b>m</b>éry
  tále</em> 45, <em>þat þei no <b>c</b>ómme þáre</em> 507.</p>

<p>The same types occur in the first hemistich; but type C disappears almost
entirely, and in the other two the last syllable not unfrequently is
accented, especially if a considerable number of unaccented syllables
occur in the middle of the hemistich; such verses may be looked upon as
remnants of types B and E:</p>

<p><em>þo was <b>c</b>róuned <b>k</b>íng</em> 28, <em>hee made a <b>u</b>éry <b>u</b>ów</em> 281, <em>and
  <b>w</b>édded þat <b>w</b>íght</em> 225, <em>þe <b>b</b>érn couth þerbý</em> 632, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Type D also seems to occur sometimes:</p>

<p><em><b>m</b>óuth <b>m</b>éete þertò</em> 184, <em>what <b>d</b>éath <b>d</b>rý[e] thou shàlt</em> 1067.</p>

<p>Besides these types the first hemistich has, as in Old English times,
some forms of its own. The succession of syllables <span class="scansion">–́××–́×</span> (type A)
is extended either by several unaccented syllables before the first
accented one (polysyllabic anacrusis) or by the insertion of a
secondary accent between the two main accented syllables, or after the
second accented syllable, with a considerable number of medial
unaccented syllables.</p>

<p>The examples under (<em>a</em>) show the tendency noticeable already in the
first hemistich of the Old English alliterative line to admit anacrusis.
The examples under (<em>b</em>) and (<em>c</em>) may be looked upon as extended forms
of types E and D.</p>

<p><a name="section56" id="section56"></a>
§ <b>56.</b> Several poems of somewhat later date deviate more frequently
from these types than the <cite>Alisaunder</cite> fragments, chiefly in the
following points:</p>

<p>The end of the hemistich sometimes consists of an accented syllable
instead of an unaccented one; the thesis is sometimes monosyllabic
instead of polysyllabic, especially in A, or the anacrusis may be
polysyllabic instead of monosyllabic. Secondary accents are introduced
more frequently into the second hemistich also, but by poets whose
technique is careful they are admitted only between the two accented
syllables. Owing to these licences, and to the introduction of
polysyllabic theses, the rhythm of the verse sometimes becomes very
heavy.</p>

<p>Belonging to this group are <cite>William of Palerne</cite>, <cite>Joseph of Arimathie</cite>,
both belonging to the middle of the fourteenth century, the three
editions of William Langland’s <cite>Vision concerning Piers Plowman</cite>, of
somewhat later date, and a few minor poems. The <cite>Romance of the
Chevelere Assigne</cite>, written in the East Midland district, at the end of
the fourteenth century,<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_94" id="Pg_94" title="94"></a> and the works of the Gawain-poet, viz. <cite>Sir
Gawain and the Green Knight</cite>, <cite>Cleanness</cite>, <cite>Patience</cite>, and the <cite>Legend
of St. Erkenwald</cite> (Horstmann, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Altengl. Legenden</cite>, 1881, p. 265), form
the transition to another group of poems belonging to the North of
England, but differing somewhat from the preceding with regard to their
metre.</p>

<p>The most important amongst these is Langland’s great work, but it is at
the same time most unequal in respect to its versification. In many
passages, especially in the beginning of the several Passus, as they are
called, the flow of the verses is very regular; in other passages the
theses are frequently of such great length, and the arsis stands out so
indistinctly, that the rhythm of the verse can only be made out with
difficulty. Some examples taken from the B-text (c. 1377) may serve to
illustrate this:</p>

<p>Extended second hemistich (Type A):</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="lines">To <b>b</b>óres and to <b>b</b>róckes | þat <b>b</b>réketh adòwn myne hégges. <span class="attrib">vi. 31.</span></div>
    <div class="lines">And so I <b>t</b>rówe <b>t</b>réwly | by þat men <b>t</b>élleth of chárite. <span class="attrib">xv. 158.</span></div>
    <div class="lines">Ac ȝut in <b>m</b>ány mo <b>m</b>áneres | <b>m</b>én offènden þe hóligòste. <span class="attrib">xvii. 280.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Extended first hemistich (Type A):</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>L</b>éue him nòuȝt, for he is <b>l</b>écherous | and <b>l</b>íkerous of tónge.
                  <span class="attrib">vi. 268.</span></div>

    <div class="line"><b>L</b>áboreres þat haue no <b>l</b>ánde | to <b>l</b>ýue on but her hándes.
                  <span class="attrib">ib. 309.</span></div>

    <div class="line">‘Now, by þe <b>p</b>éril of my soúle!’ quod Pieres, | ‘I shal a<b>p</b>éyre
     ȝou álle!’</div>
      <div class="attribution">vi. 173.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Such verses obviously contain only two beats in each hemistich,
although at the same time some of the syllables forming the thesis may
have a somewhat stronger accent than others. For as a rule such extended
verses are succeeded by a normal line, clearly bringing out again the
general four-beat rhythm, as is the case with the line (A + A) following
immediately upon the last-mentioned example:</p>

<div class="iline">And <b>h</b>óuped after <b>h</b>únger | þat <b>h</b>érd hym atte fírste.
                <span class="attrib">vi. 174.</span></div>

<p>Type A is in <cite>Piers Plowman</cite> the usual one, but the types C and BC
frequently occur. In the following examples we have type C in the second
hemistich:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_95" id="Pg_95" title="95"></a></p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">And hadden <b>l</b>éue to <b>l</b>ye | al here <b>l</b>ýf áfter. <span class="attrib">Prol. 49.</span></div>
    <div class="line">I seigh <b>s</b>ómme that <b>s</b>éiden | þei had  y<b>s</b>óuȝt <b>s</b>éyntes.
                            <span class="attrib">ib. 50;</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>in the first hemistich it occurs rarely:</p>

<div class="iline">Ac on a <b>M</b>áy <b>m</b>órnynge | on <b>M</b>áluerne húlles. <span class="attrib">ib. 5.</span></div>

<p>Type B C is frequently to be met with in both hemistichs; e.g. in the
first:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">In a <b>s</b>ómer <b>s</b>éson, | whan <b>s</b>óft was the <b>s</b>ónne. <span class="attrib">ib. 1.</span></div>
    <div class="line">And as I <b>l</b>áy and <b>l</b>éned | and <b>l</b>óked in þe wáteres. <span class="attrib">ib. 9;</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>in the second:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>B</b>ídders and <b>b</b>éggeres | fast a<b>b</b>óute ȝéde. <span class="attrib">ib. 40.</span></div>
    <div class="line"><b>W</b>énten to <b>W</b>álsyngham, | and here <b>w</b>énches áfter. <span class="attrib">ib. 54.</span></div>
   </div>
</div>

<p>Masculine endings, however (originating from the dropping of the final
<em>-e</em> in the last words of the types A and C, as e.g. in <em>and <b>d</b>rédful
of síght</em> Prol. 16, <em><b>c</b>ristened þe <b>k</b>ýnge</em> xv. 437, <em>as þe kýng híght</em>
iii. 9), occur very rarely here. They are, on the other hand,
characteristic forms in another group of alliterative poems.</p>

<p><a name="section57" id="section57"></a>
§ <b>57.</b> These belong to the <b>North of England</b> and the adjacent parts
of the Midlands.</p>

<p>In these districts the final <em>e</em> had by this time become silent, or was
in the course of becoming so. Thus many verses of West-Midland poems
were shortened in the North by omitting the final <em>-e</em>, and then these
forms were imitated there. Hence the middle of the line was much less
modified than the end of it.</p>

<p>Types A, C, B C, therefore, occur not only in the ordinary forms with
unaccented syllables at the end, but also, although more rarely, with
accented ones, viz. corresponding to the schemes:</p>

<p class="center">A<sub>1</sub>, <span class="scansion">(×)–́××–́</span>,  C<sub>1</sub>, <span class="scansion">(×)××–́–́</span>,  BC<sub>1</sub>, <span class="scansion">(×)××–́×–́</span>.</p>

<p>These forms of the hemistich first occur in the <cite>Destruction of Troy</cite>,
a poem written in a West-Midland dialect very like to the Northern
dialect, and in the North-English poems, <cite>Morte Arthure</cite> and <cite>The Wars
of Alexander</cite> (E. E. T. S., Extra-Ser. 47). Examples of these types
(taken from the first-mentioned poem) are: of type A<sub>1</sub> in the second
hemistich, <em>for <b>l</b>érning of ús</em> 32, <em>þat <b>ó</b>nest were <b>á</b>y</em> 48; with a
polysyllabic thesis, <em>and <b>l</b>ympit of the sóthe</em> 36; with a secondary
accent,<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_96" id="Pg_96" title="96"></a><em>with <b>c</b>léne mèn of wít</em> 790; without anacrusis,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> <em><b>l</b>émond

disyllabic anacrusis, <em>þat ben <b>d</b>répit with <b>d</b>éth</em> 9, <em>þat with the
<b>G</b>rékys was <b>g</b>rét</em> 40; without anacrusis, <em><b>B</b>ýg y-noghe vnto <b>b</b>éd</em>
397, <em><b>T</b>rýed men þat were <b>t</b>áken</em> 258, &amp;c.; examples for C<sub>1</sub> (only
occurring in the second hemistich), <em>þat he <b>f</b>óre with</em> 44, <em>into your

<em>of my <b>c</b>órs hás</em> 1865; examples for B C<sub>1</sub>, in the second hemistich
(of rare occurrence), <em>when it de<b>st</b>róyet wás</em> 28, <em>and to <b>s</b>órow
bróght</em> 1497, <em>þere þe <b>c</b>ítie wás</em> 1534.</p>

<p>The same modification of types took place later in other parts of the
Midlands, as appears from two works of the early sixteenth century,
<cite>Scottish Field</cite> and <cite>Death and Life</cite> (Bishop Percy’s Folio MS.,
edited by Furnivall and Hales, i. 199 and iii. 49). The last
North-English or rather Scottish poem, on the other hand, written in
alliterative lines without rhyme, Dunbar’s well-known Satire, <cite>The twa
mariit wemen and the wedo</cite>, has, apart from the normal types occurring
in the North-English poems, many variants, chiefly in the first
hemistich, which are characterized by lengthy unaccented parts both at
the beginning of the line, before the second arsis, and after it;
frequently too syllables forming the thesis have a secondary accent and
even take part in the alliteration, as e.g. in the following examples:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><b>Ȝ</b>aip and <b>ȝ</b>íng, in the <b>ȝ</b>ók | ane <b>ȝ</b>éir for to dráw. <span class="attrib">79.</span></div>
    <div class="line">Is <b>b</b>àir of <b>b</b>lís and <b>b</b>áilfull, | and greit <b>b</b>árrat wírkis. <span class="attrib">51.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes the second hemistich participates in this cumulation of
alliterating words, which not unfrequently extends over several, even as
many as six or seven consecutive lines:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">He <b>g</b>ráythit me in <b>g</b>áy silk | and <b>g</b>údlie arráyis,</div>
    <div class="line">In <b>g</b>ównis of in<b>g</b>ránit clayth | and <b>g</b>reit <b>g</b>óldin chénȝeis.
                                                                  <span class="attrib">365&ndash;6.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This explains how King James VI came to formulate the metrical rule
mentioned above (p. 89) from the misuse of alliteration by the last
poets who used the alliterative line, or the alliterative rhyming
line to be discussed in the next paragraph, which shares the same
peculiarity.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_97" id="Pg_97" title="97"></a></p>


<h4>B. The alliterative line combined with rhyme</h4>

<p><a name="section58" id="section58"></a>
§ <b>58.</b> In spite of the great popularity which the regular alliterative
line enjoyed down to the beginning of the Modern English period,
numerous and important rivals had arisen in the meantime, viz. the many
even-beat rhymed kinds of verse formed on foreign models; and these
soon began to influence the alliterative line. The first mark of this
influence was that end-rhyme and strophic formation was forced upon
many alliterative poems. In a further stage the alliterative line was
compelled to accommodate its free rhythm of four accents bit by bit
to that of the even-beat metres, especially to the closely-related
four-foot iambic line, and thus to transform itself into a more or
less regular iambic-anapaestic metre. The alliterative line, on the
other hand, exercised a counter influence on the newer forms of verse,
inasmuch as alliteration, which was formerly peculiar to native
versification, took possession in course of time to a considerable
extent of the even-beat metres, especially of the four-foot iambic
verse. But by this reciprocal influence of the two forms of verse the
blending of the four-beat alliterative line with that of four equal
measures and the ultimate predominance of the even-beat metres was
brought about more easily and naturally.</p>

<p>Alliterative-rhymed lines, the connexion of which into stanzas or
staves will be treated of in the second part of this work under the
heading of the ‘Bob-wheel-stanza’, were used during the Middle English
period alike in lyric, epic, and dramatic poetry.</p>

<p><a name="section59" id="section59"></a>
§ <b>59. Lyrical stanzas.</b> The earliest stanzas written in alliterative
rhyming lines were lyrical.</p>

<p>We must distinguish between isometric and anisometric stanza forms.
In the former the whole stanza consists of four-beat alliterative
lines, commonly rhyming according to a very simple scheme (either <em>a a
a a</em> or <em>a b a b</em>). In the latter four-beat long lines as a rule are
combined with isolated lines of one measure only and with several of
two measures to form the stanza. The two-beat verses frequently have a
somewhat lengthened structure (to be discussed further on sections on
the epic stanzas), in consequence of which many of them having theses
with secondary accents can be read either as even-beat verses of three
measures or as three-beat verses on the model of those in <cite>King Horn</cite>.
The four-beat alliterative lines, on the other hand, are mostly of more
regular structure, the distances between the first and second arsis
not being<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_98" id="Pg_98" title="98"></a> so unequal and the theses as a rule being disyllabic. The
anacrusis too in these verses admits of a somewhat free treatment.
The difference, however, between the first and second hemistich is
less conspicuous than it was in those forms of the Middle English
alliterative line before mentioned. Alliteration, on the other hand, is
abundantly used.</p>

<p>The main rhythmic character of the verse is again indicated here by
the frequent occurrence of the types A and A<sub>1</sub>. The types B C, B C<sub>1</sub>,
C, C<sub>1</sub>, however, likewise occur pretty often, and the two last types
present serious obstacles to the assumption that the lines of these
poems were ever recited with an even beat. But how exactly these poems
were recited or to what sort of musical accompaniment can hardly be
definitely decided in the absence of external evidence.</p>

<p>The first verses of a West-Midland poem of the end of the thirteenth
century (Wright’s <cite>Political Songs</cite>, p. 149) may serve as a specimen:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Ich herde <b>m</b>én vpo <b>m</b>óld | <b>m</b>áke muche <b>m</b>ón,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Hou hé beþ i<b>t</b>éned | of here <b>t</b>ílýnge:</div>
    <div class="line"><b>G</b>óde ȝeres and córn | bóþe beþ a<b>g</b>ón,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Ne képeþ here no <b>s</b>áwe | ne no <b>s</b>óng <b>s</b>ýnge.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The second hemistichs in ll. 2 and 4 belong to type C. In other poems
also, with lines of more regular rhythm (chiefly type A), this type
may be met with now and then, e.g. in a poem published in Wright’s
<cite>Specimens of Lyric Poetry</cite>, p. 25, especially in the second hemistich,
e.g. <em>haueþ þis <b>m</b>ái <b>m</b>ére</em>, line 9, <em>and þe <b>g</b>ýlófre</em>, line
40, <em>þat þe <b>b</b>ór <b>b</b>éde</em>, line 44.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to distinguish such rhymed four-beat alliterative
lines from those of four measures which have fairly regular
alliteration, for the long line of the native metre always has a
somewhat looser fabric, not the even-beat rhythmic cadence peculiar
to the iambic verse of four measures, and, secondly, it always has a
caesura after the first hemistich, whereas the even-beat verse of four
measures may either lack distinct caesura or the caesura may occur in
other places in the verse as well as after the second arsis. This will
be evident by comparing the following four-beat verses of the last
stanza of a poem in Wright’s <cite>Spec. of Lyr. Poetry</cite>, p. 31:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line"><b>R</b>íchard | <b>r</b>óte of <b>r</b>ésoun <b>r</b>ýght,</div>
    <div class="line indent2"><b>r</b>ýkeníng of <b>r</b>ým ant <b>r</b>ón,</div>
    <div class="line">Of <b>m</b>áidnes <b>m</b>éke þóu hast <b>m</b>ýht,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">on <b>m</b>ólde y hólde þe <b>m</b>úrgest <b>m</b>ón;</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_99" id="Pg_99" title="99"></a></p>

<p>with the following first four-beat alliterative lines of another poem
(ibid. p. 25):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Ichot a <b>b</b>úrde in a <b>b</b>óure, | ase <b>b</b>éryl so <b>b</b>rýght,</div>

    <div class="line">Ase <b>g</b>érnet in <b>g</b>ólde, | and <b>r</b>úby wel <b>r</b>ýht.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In similar lines are written several other poems, as <cite><b>M</b>on in þe
<b>m</b>one</cite> (ibid. p. 110); <cite>Of <b>r</b>ibaudz y <b>r</b>yme</cite> (Wright’s <cite>Pol. Songs</cite>,
p. 237); and five songs by Laurence Minot (nos. ii, v, ix, x, xi),
written in the middle of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p><a name="section60" id="section60"></a>
§ <b>60.</b> In other poems the four-beat long lines used in the main part
of the stanza are followed by shorter lines forming the cauda, which in
part are of a variable rhythmic cadence either of three beats (or three
measures) or of two beats, as e.g. in the well-known poem in Percy’s
<cite>Reliques</cite>, ii, p. 1.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The first stanza may be quoted here:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Sitteþ alle stílle | and hérkneþ to mé:</div>
    <div class="line">Þe kýng of Alemáigne, | bi mi léauté,</div>
    <div class="line">Þrítti þousent pound | áskede hé</div>

    <div class="line indent2">Trícchen shàlt þou néuer mòre.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In the following stanzas of this poem the four-beat rhythm, although
rarely marked by regular alliteration, is (in the main part or ‘frons’)
still more distinctly recognizable, in spite of several rhythmically
incorrect lines.</p>

<p>Second hemistichs of the type C<sub>1</sub> are not infrequent, e.g. <em>opon
swývýng</em> 9, <em>sire Édwárd</em> 46, <em>o þy lýárd</em> 47. Lines 5 and 7 are of a
two-beat rhythm, l. 8 probably as well (cf. our scansion).</p>

<p>There is a decided similarity in regard to structure and versification
between this stanza and that of a poem in Wright’s <cite>Pol. Songs</cite>, p.
153, although the long lines are divided in the middle by interlaced
rhyme. This may be illustrated by its second stanza:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_100" id="Pg_100" title="100"></a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Nou haþ <b>p</b>rúde þe <ins class="correction" title="original: pŕis"><b>p</b>rís</ins><a name="CORR_4" id="CORR_4"></a> | in éuervche <b>p</b>láwe,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>There is no line here corresponding to l. 5 of the preceding poem.
Otherwise, however, the <em>cauda</em> of this poem is of a similar structure
to that of the preceding one, at least in this and possibly in the
following stanzas, whereas the last line of the first stanza has a
two-beat rhythm, and in the others the last lines probably are to be
scanned with three beats. The second line of the <em>cauda</em> of the first
stanza of this poem belongs to type C. Another poem (Wright’s <cite>Polit.
Songs</cite>, p. 155; Böddeker, <cite>P.L.</cite> no. iv) shows a very artificial form of
stanza, either corresponding to the formula <span class="rhyme">a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> d d<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> e e<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> f f g g g f<sub>2</sub></span> (if we look upon the verses as four-beat and
two-beat lines, which the poet probably intended), or corresponding to
the formula <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> d d<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> e e<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> f f g g g f<sub>2</sub></em> (if we look
upon the <em>frons</em> as consisting of ordinary tail-rhyme-stanza lines of
four and three even-beat measures).</p>

<p>The four- and two-beat cadence of the verses comes out still more
clearly in the stanzas of another poem (Wright’s <cite>Pol. Songs</cite>, p. 187;
Ritson, <cite>Anc. Songs</cite>, i. 51; Böddeker, <cite>P.L.</cite> no. v), the rhymes of
which follow the scheme <em>a a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em> (extended
tail-rhyme-stanzas). Some of its long lines, it is true, admit of being
read as even-beat verses of three measures, e.g. <em>and béo huere
chéuentéyn</em> 20, <em>and móni anóþer swéyn</em> 24, but the true scansion in all
probability is <em>and béo huere chéuenteȳ̀n</em> (or <em>chèuentéyn</em>): <em>ant
móni anòþer swéyn</em>, in conformity with the scansion of the following
lines <em>to cóme to parís: þourh þe flóur de lís</em> 52&ndash;6, or <em>wiþ éorl and
wiþ knýht: with húem forte fýht</em> 124&ndash;8.</p>

<p>As a first step to the epic forms of stanza to be considered in the next
paragraph a poem of the early fourteenth century (Wright’s <cite>Pol. Songs</cite>,
p. 212; Ritson, <cite>Anc. Songs</cite>, p. 28; Böddeker, <cite>P.L.</cite> no. vi) may be
quoted:</p>

<p>The fifth line has one arsis only (as appears more clearly from that
in the second stanza: <em>wiþ Lóue</em>), thus corresponding to the
above-mentioned poems (pp. 99, 100); the other lines of the <em>cauda</em>
have two stresses.</p>

<p>Prof. Luick<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> looks upon the long lines of this poem and of several
others (e.g. Wright’s <cite>Pol. Songs</cite>, pp. 69 and 187) as doubled native
verses of the progressive or Layamon form, but rhyming only as long
lines. This can hardly be, as the rhythmic structure of these verses
does not differ from that of the other poems quoted above, which belong,
according to Prof. Luick himself, to the class of the normal, lyric
rhyming-alliterative lines.</p>

§ <b>61. Narrative verse.</b> Alliterative-rhyming verses occur in their
purest form in narrative poetry, especially in a number of poems
composed during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in stanzas of
thirteen lines, and republished recently in a collective edition by the
Scottish Text Society in vol. 27 under the title <cite>Scottish Alliterative
Poems</cite> (ed. by F.J. Amours, Edinburgh, 1892). The poems contained in
this collection are <cite>Golagras and Gawane</cite> (also in <cite>Anglia</cite>, ii. 395),
<cite>The Book of the Howlat</cite> by Holland, <cite>Rauf Coilȝear</cite> (also in E. E.
T. S., Extr.-Ser. vol. xxxix), <cite>The Awntyrs off Arthure at the Terne
Wathelyne</cite>, <cite>The Pistill of Susan</cite> (also in <cite>Anglia</cite>, i. 93). Douglas’s
<cite>Prologue</cite> to the Eighth Book of his translation of the <cite>Aeneid</cite>
(although written in the beginning of the sixteenth century) likewise
belongs to this group, as do also the poems of John Audelay, composed in
Shropshire in the fifteenth century (Percy Soc. xiv, p. 10 ff.), and a
poem <cite>Of Sayne John the Euaungelist</cite> (E. E. T. S. 26, p. 87) written in
stanzas of fourteen lines in the North of England. The stanzas of all
these poems&mdash;generally speaking&mdash;consist of two unequal parts, the
<em>frons</em> written in alliterative lines, rhyming according to the formula
<em>a b a b a b a b</em>, and the <em>cauda</em> which contains five or six lines, the
first of which may either be a long line as in the <em>frons</em>, or, as in
<cite>The Pistill of Susan</cite>, a short one-beat one, with four two-beat
sectional verses following. Only in the last-mentioned poem does the
<em>cauda</em> consist of six two-beat sectional verses.</p>

<p>The rhythm of this alliterative-rhyming metre may first be illustrated
by the opening lines of <cite>Golagras and Gawane</cite>:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Lines like the four last quoted illustrate the normal structure of the
rhyming-alliterative verse, especially the relationship of rhyme and
alliteration to each other in monosyllabic and disyllabic words. It will
be seen that the rhyming syllable, as a rule the root-syllable, or at
least the accented syllable of the word, at the same time carries the
fourth accent of the line, and in consequence the fourth alliterative
sound. In all other respects the rhymed-alliterative verse is
structurally similar to that without rhyme, and it is therefore evident
that rhyme exercises no decisive influence on the rhythm of the verse.
In this comparatively pure form&mdash;if we do not take into account the
secondary accents occurring in the first hemistichs of the stanza in the
later poem&mdash;are written the great majority of the lines in the earliest
of poems mentioned above, viz. <cite>The Awntyrs off Arthure</cite>.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_103" id="Pg_103"></a></p>

<p><a name="section62" id="section62"></a>
§ <b>62.</b> The relation, however, between rhyme and alliteration and
consequently the relation of the rhythmic accentuation of the words to
their natural accentuation is less clear in the first stanza quoted
above. The following verses rhyming together may serve to elucidate
this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Than schir <b>G</b>áwyne the <b>g</b>áy, | <b>g</b>úde and <b>g</b>ráciùs....</div>
    <div class="line"><b>J</b>óly and <b>g</b>éntill, | and full <b>ch</b>éuailrús.</div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="attribution">Gol. 389, 391.</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Ouer heor <b>h</b>édes gon <b>h</b>ýng</div>
    <div class="line">Þe <b>w</b>ínce and þe <b>w</b>éderlȳ̀ng.</div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="attribution">Susan, 101&ndash;2;</div>

<p>or the verses <cite>Gol.</cite> 648, 650, 654:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Thus <b>é</b>ndit the <b>á</b>uynantis | with mékil h<b>ó</b>nòur;</div>
    <div class="line">Thair <b>b</b>ódeis wes <b>b</b>éryit | <b>b</b>áith in ane hòur,</div>
    <div class="line">Ane <b>ú</b>thir heght <b>É</b>dmond, | that <b>p</b>róuit <b>p</b>áramòur.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In the first couplet the last syllable of the word <em>gráciùs</em>, although
bearing only a secondary accent and forming the last thesis of the
verse, rhymes with the last syllable of the word <em><b>ch</b>éuailrús</em>, which
likewise in ordinary speech has a secondary accent, but here is the
bearer of the fourth metrical accent of the verse. In the second
couplet the syllable <em>lyng</em> of the word <em>wéderlỳng</em>, which has a
secondary accent and forms part of the thesis, rhymes with the word
<em>hyng</em> which has the rhythmical accent. In the last group of verses the
last syllable of the words <em>paramour</em>, <em>honour</em> having secondary accents
rhymes with the word <em>hour</em>, the bearer of the last rhythmical accent.
Similar rhymes occur even in Modern English poetry, e.g. in the works
of Thomas Moore: <em>Váin were its mélodỳ, Róse, without thée</em> or <em>Whát
would the Róse bè Únsung by thée?</em><a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>It also frequently happens that all the rhyming syllables, which have a
secondary accent and occur in the thesis of a verse, belong to
trisyllabic words, while the accented syllables in the arsis, whether
alliterating or not, do not take part in the rhyme, e.g.:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="lines">Þou brak gódes Comáundement,</div>
    <div class="lines">To slé such an Ínnocent</div>
    <div class="lines">With ény fals júggement. <span class="attrib">Susan, 321&ndash;3.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Similar unaccented rhymes are also met with in disyllabic words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="lines">‘In fáith,’ said Schir Rólland,</div>
    <div class="lines">‘That is fúll euill wýn land</div>
    <div class="lines">To háue quhill thow ar léuand.’ <span class="attrib">Rauf Coilȝear, 917&ndash;19.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Other rhymes of the same kind are <em>sémbland: léuand</em>, <em>conséntand :
endúrand</em>, Gol. 428 ff., &amp;c.</p>

<p>In all such cases the natural accentuation of the words is not
interfered with by the rhythm of the verse.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_104" id="Pg_104" title="104"></a></p>

<p>The kind of irregular rhyme most frequently occurring, however, is that
which is formed by the unaccented syllable of a disyllabic word (the
first syllable of which alliterates and bears the last arsis of the
verse) rhyming with a monosyllabic word which likewise bears the fourth
rhythmical accent of another alliterative line (or the second of a short
line forming part of the cauda) and takes part in the alliteration as
well, as e.g. in the rhymes <em><b>T</b>úskane: sane: <b>B</b>rítane: gane</em> and
<em><b>s</b>úmmovne: <b>r</b>énovne: <b>c</b>rovne</em> of the above-mentioned stanza of the
poem <cite>Golagras and Gawane</cite>.</p>

<p>It is not likely that a complete shifting of accent in favour of the
rhyming syllable ever took place, as the first syllables of the words
usually take part in the alliteration, and therefore have a strongly
marked accent. Sometimes, it is true, in the poems of this epoch,
unaccented syllables do participate in the alliteration, and in the case
of the words <em>Tuskane</em>, <em>Britane</em>, <em>summovne</em>, <em>renovne</em> their Romance
origin would explain the accent on the last syllable; but these words,
both as to their position and as to their treatment in the line, are
exactly on a par with the Germanic rhyme-words in ll. 870&ndash;2:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">For he wes <b>b</b>ýrsit and <b>b</b>éft,ỳ | ỳand <b>b</b>ráithly <b>b</b>lédand ...</div>
    <div class="line">And wáld that he nane <b>h</b>árm hyntỳ | ỳwith <b>h</b>árt and with <b>h</b>ánd.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In both cases we thus have ‘accented-unaccented rhymes’ (cf. Chapter I
in Book II), which probably were uttered in oral recitation with a
certain level stress. This is probable for several reasons. First it is
to be borne in mind that Germanic words in even-beat rhythms of earlier
and contemporary poems were used in the same way, e.g.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Quhen thái of Lórne has séne the kíng</div>
    <div class="line">Set ín hymsélff sa grét helpíng. <span class="attrib">Barbour, Bruce, iii. 147&ndash;8.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">And bád thame wénd intó Scotlánd</div>
    <div class="line">And sét a sége with stálward hánd. <span class="attrib">ib. iv. 79&ndash;80.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Only in these cases the rhythmical accent supersedes the word accent
which has to accommodate itself to the former, while in the uneven-beat
rhythm of the four-beat alliterative line the word-accent still
predominates. In the even-beat lines, therefore, the rhythmical accent
rests on the last syllable of a disyllabic rhyme-word, but in the
alliterative lines it rests on the penultimate. In the case of words of
Romance origin, however, which during this period of the language could
be used either with Germanic or with Romanic accentuation, the
displacement of the<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_105" id="Pg_105" title="105"></a> word-accent by the rhythmic accent in
non-alliterative words may in these cases have been somewhat more
extensive; cf. e.g. rhymes like <em>rage: curáge: suáge</em> Gol. 826&ndash;8; <em>day
: gay: journáy</em> ib. 787&ndash;9; <em>assáill: mettáill: battáil</em> R.
Coilȝear, 826&ndash;8, &amp;c. (but <em>ȝone <b>b</b>érne in the <b>b</b>áttale</em> Gol.
806).</p>

<p>As a rule, however, for these too the same level-stress accentuation
must be assumed as for the rhyme-words of the first stanza of <cite>Golagras</cite>
quoted above (p. 102)</p>

<p><a name="section63" id="section63"></a>
§ <b>63.</b> This is all the more probable because, in these
alliterative-rhyming poems, there are many sectional verses
corresponding to the old types C and C<sub>1</sub>, these answering best the
combined requirements of alliteration and of end-rhyme, for which
frequently one and the same Germanic or Romanic word had to suffice in
the second hemistich, as e.g. in the following sectional verses rhyming
together:&mdash;<em>What is þi góod réde: for his <b>k</b>níȝthéde: (by <b>cr</b>ósse
and by <b>cr</b>éde)</em> Awnt. of Arth. 93&ndash;7; (<em>and <b>b</b>láke to þe <b>b</b>óne): as a
<b>w</b>ómáne</em> ib. 105&ndash;7; <em>en<b>c</b>lósed with a <b>c</b>rowne: of the <b>t</b>résóne</em> ib.
287&ndash;91; <em>of ane fáir <b>w</b>éll: <b>t</b>éirfull to <b>t</b>éll: with ane <b>c</b>ástéll
: <b>k</b>éne and <b>c</b>rúèll</em>, or, as Prof. Luick scans, <em>kéne and cruéll</em> (but
l. 92 <em><b>c</b>rúel and <b>k</b>éne</em>) Gol. 40&ndash;6; <em>at the mýddáy: (<b>w</b>ént thai
thar wáy)</em> Howl. 665&ndash;7. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Also in the even-beat metres the influence of this type is still
perceptible; cf. rhymes like</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Súmwhat óf his clóþíng</div>
    <div class="line">Fór þe lóue of héuene kýng. <span class="attrib">Rob. Mannyng, Handl. Sinne, 5703&ndash;4.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>


<p>which are of frequent occurrence.</p>

<p>For the rest both in these alliterative-rhyming poems and in the poems
with alliteration only the types A and A<sub>1</sub>, B C and B C<sub>1</sub> are frequent.
These alliterative-rhyming lines have this feature in common with the
pure alliterative lines, that the first hemistich differs materially
from the second in having often an anacrusis of several syllables
(initial theses) and somewhat lengthened theses in the middle of the
line, and in permitting such theses with only a secondary accent to take
part in the alliteration. All this tends to give a somewhat heavy
rhythmic cadence to the whole line.</p>

<p><a name="section64" id="section64"></a>
§ <b>64.</b> The same difference is perceptible, as Prof. Luick was the first
to show (<cite>Anglia</cite>, xii, pp. 438 ff.), in the single two-beat lines of
the <em>cauda</em>, the three first (ll. 10&ndash;12 of the whole stanza) having the
looser structure of the extended first hemistichs of the long lines,
while the last two-beat line (line 13 of the whole<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_106" id="Pg_106" title="106"></a> stanza) has the
normal structure (commonly type A, A<sub>1</sub>, as e.g. <em>Birnand <b>th</b>rétty
and <b>th</b>ré</em> Gol. 247; <em>Of góld that wes cléir</em> ib. 1) of second
sections of the long line, as is evident from the first stanza of
<cite>Golagras and Gawane</cite> quoted above (p. 102). In this concluding line,
however, other types of verse peculiar to the second hemistich of long
lines may also be met with, as e.g. C, C<sub>1</sub>, <span class="gesperrt">BC</span>, <span class="gesperrt">BC<sub>1</sub></span>, e.g.: <em>For thi
mánhéde</em> Awnt. of Arth. 350; <em>Withoutin dístánce</em> Gol. 1362; <em>As I am
tréw kníght</em> Gol. 169; <em>Couth na léid sáy</em> ib. 920; <em>In ony ríche réime</em>
ib. 1258, <em>Quhen he wes líghtit dóun</em> ib. 130.</p>

<p>In other poems the group of short lines rhyming according to the scheme
<em>a a a b</em> and forming part of the <em>cauda</em> is preceded neither by a long
alliterative line nor by a one-beat half section of it (as in <cite>Susan</cite>),
but by a complete two-beat sectional verse, which then, in the same way
as the last verse rhyming with it, corresponds in its structure to that
of the second hemistich of the long line; as e.g. in <cite>The Tournament of
Tottenham</cite> (Ritson’s <cite>Ancient Songs</cite>, i. 85&ndash;94), rhyming on the scheme
<em>A A A A b c c c b</em> (the capitals signifying the long lines), and in
<cite>The Ballad of Kynd Kittok</cite>, possibly by W. Dunbar (Laing, ii. 35, 36;
Small, i. 52, 53; Schipper, 70).</p>

<p>In <cite>Sayne John the Euaungelist</cite> the ‘cauda’ has the structure of a
complete tail-rhyme-stanza, the order of rhymes of the whole stanza
being <em>A B A B A B A B c c d c c d</em></p>

<p><a name="section65" id="section65"></a>
§ <b>65.</b> In connexion with this it is particularly interesting to note
that such two-beat sections of the alliterative line are also used by
themselves for whole poems written in tail-rhyme-stanzas (as was first
shown by Prof. Luick, <cite>Anglia</cite>, xii, pp. 440 ff.); cf. e.g. the
translation of the <cite>Disticha Catonis</cite> (E.E.T.S. 68), the two first
stanzas of which may be quoted here:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

      <div class="line">If þóu be made wíttenèsse,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_107" id="Pg_107" title="107"></a></p>

<p>In the same stanza <cite>The Feest</cite> (Hazlitt, <cite>Remains</cite>, iii. 93) is written.</p>

<p>Still more frequently such lines were used for extended
tail-rhyme-stanzas rhyming on the scheme <em>a a a b c c c b d d d b e e e b</em>,
as e.g. in a poem, <cite>The Enemies of Mankind</cite>, of the beginning of
the fourteenth century, published by Kölbing (<cite>Engl. Studien</cite>, ix. 440
ff.).</p>

<p>The first stanza runs as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Þe <b>s</b>ìker <b>s</b>óþe who so <b>s</b>éys,</div>
    <div class="line">Wiþ <b>d</b>ìol <b>d</b>réye we our <b>d</b>áys</div>
    <div class="line">And <b>w</b>àlk máni <b>w</b>il <b>w</b>áys</div>
    <div class="line indent4">As <b>w</b>ándrand <b>w</b>íȝtes.</div>

    <div class="line"><b>D</b>èþ, þat <b>d</b>érieþ ous swá</div>
    <div class="line indent4">And <b>d</b>íolely ous <b>d</b>íȝtes.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Here, again, the difference between the lines on the pattern of the
first hemistich of the long line, which form the body of the stanza (<em>a
a a, b b b, c c c, d d d</em>), and those on the pattern of the second
hemistich used as tail-rhyme lines (<em>b, b, b, b</em>) is plainly
recognizable.</p>

<p>The same is the case in other poems written in this form of stanza, as
e.g. in the Metrical Romances, <cite>Sir Perceval</cite>, <cite>Sir Degrevant</cite>
(Halliwell, <cite>Thornton Romances</cite>, Camden Society, 1844, pp. 1, 177) and
others; cf. Luick, <cite>Anglia</cite>, xii, pp. 440ff., and Paul’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Grundriss</cite>, ii
a, p. 1016. But in these later works, one of the latest of which
probably is the poem <cite>The Droichis Part of the Play</cite>, possibly by Dunbar
(Laing, ii. 37; Small, ii. 314; Schipper, 190), the two-beat lines are
frequently intermingled and blended with even-beat lines, which from the
beginning of the fifth stanza onward completely take the place of the
two-beat lines in the last-mentioned poem. Likewise in the
‘Bob-wheel-staves’, i.e. stanzas of the structure of those
sixteenth-century stanzas quoted above (§§ <a href="#section60">60</a>, <a href="#section61">61</a>), the <em>cauda</em>,<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_108" id="Pg_108" title="108"></a> as is
expressly stated by King James VI in his <cite>Revlis and Cavtelis</cite>, is
written in even-beat lines of four and three measures, though the main
part of the stanza (the <em>frons</em>) is composed in four-beat
rhyming-alliterative lines (cf. Luick, <cite>Anglia</cite>, xii, P. 444)</p>

<p><a name="section66" id="section66"></a>
§ <b>66.</b> In the contemporary <b>Dramatic Poetry</b> this mixture of four-beat
(or two-beat) alliterative lines with lines of even measures is still
more frequent, and may be used either strophically or otherwise.</p>

<p>In the first place, we must note that in the earlier collections of
Mystery Plays (<cite>Towneley Mysteries</cite>, <cite>York Plays</cite>, and <cite>Ludus
Coventriae</cite>) the rhyming alliterative long line, popular, as we have
seen, in lyric and in narrative poetry, is also used in the same or
cognate forms of stanzas.</p>

<p>But the form of verse in these Mysteries, owing to the loss of regular
alliteration, cannot with propriety be described as the four-beat
alliterative long line, but only as the four-beat long line. In many
instances, however, the remnants of alliteration decidedly point to the
four-beat character of this rhythm, as e.g. in the following stanza of
the <cite>Towneley Mysteries</cite> (p. 140):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Moste <b>m</b>ýghty <b>M</b>áhòwne | <b>m</b>éng you with <b>m</b>ýrthe,</div>
    <div class="line">Both of búrgh and of tówne | by <b>f</b>éllys and by <b>f</b>ýrthe;</div>
    <div class="line">Both <b>k</b>ýng with <b>c</b>równe | and <b>b</b>árons of <b>b</b>írthe,</div>
    <div class="line">That <b>r</b>ádly wylle <b>r</b>ówne, | many <b>g</b>réatt <b>g</b>ríthe</div>
    <div class="line indent14">Shalle be hápp;</div>
    <div class="line indent8">Take <b>t</b>énderly in<b>t</b>ént</div>
    <div class="line indent8">What <b>s</b>óndes ar <b>s</b>ént,</div>
    <div class="line indent8">Els <b>h</b>ármes shall ye <b>h</b>ént</div>
    <div class="line indent14">And <b>l</b>óthes you to <b>l</b>ap.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In this form of stanza the different groups of lines or even single
lines are frequently, as e.g. in the so-called <cite>Processus Noe</cite> (the
<cite>Play of the Flood</cite>), very skilfully divided between several persons
taking part in the dialogue. The interlaced rhyme in the long lines
connects it with the stanza form of the lyric poem quoted above (<a href="#Pg_100">p.
100</a>), and the form of the ‘cauda’ relates it to that of the lyric poem
quoted (<a href="#Pg_101">p. 101</a>), and in this respect is identical with that of <cite>The
Pistill of Susan</cite>.</p>

<p>The rhythmic treatment of the verses is, both with regard to the
relation between rhyme and the remnants of alliteration and to the use
of the Middle English types of verse, on the whole the same as was
described in §§ 62&ndash;4 treating of this form of verse in narrative poetry.
The types A and A<sub>1</sub>, B C and B C<sub>1</sub>,<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_109" id="Pg_109" title="109"></a> are chiefly met with; now and then,
however, type C<sub>1</sub> also occurs in the second hemistich, as e.g. in the
verses <em>that wold vówch sáyf</em> 172, <em>of the tént máyne</em> 487, <em>wille com
agáne sóne</em> 488, of the <cite>Play of the Flood</cite> mentioned above.</p>

<p>But in the ‘cauda’ the difference explained in § 65 between first and
second short lines forming the close of a stanza is often very regularly
observed.</p>

<p>In other places of the <cite>Towneley Mysteries</cite> similar stanzas are written
in lines which have almost an alexandrine rhythm (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, i. 229),
while, on the other hand, in the <cite>Coventry Mysteries</cite> we not
unfrequently meet with stanzas of the same form written in lines which,
in consequence of their concise structure, approach even-beat lines of
four measures, or directly pass into this metre. The intermixture of
different kinds of line is even carried here to such a length that to a
<em>frons</em> of four-beat lines is joined a <em>cauda</em> of even-beat lines of
four or three measures corresponding to King James VI’s rule quoted
above (p. 108) for such stanzas; and on the other hand to a <em>frons</em> of
even-beat lines of four measures is joined a <em>cauda</em> of two-beat short
lines.</p>

<p><a name="section67" id="section67"></a>
§ <b>67.</b> The distinctly four-beat line, however, still forms the staple
of the different kinds of verse occurring in these poems, and was also
used in them for simple forms of stanza. In the further development of
dramatic poetry it remained much in use. Skelton’s Moral Play
<cite>Magnificence</cite>, and most of the Moralities and Interludes contained in
Dodsley’s <cite>Old Plays</cite> (ed. Hazlitt), vols. i-iv, are written chiefly in
this popular metre. As a rule it rhymes here in couplets, and under the
influence of the even-beat measures used in the same dramatic pieces it
gradually assumes a pretty regular iambic-anapaestic or
trochaic-dactylic rhythm. This applies for the most part to the humorous
and popular parts; allegorical and historical personages are made to
converse in even-beat verses.</p>

<p>Verses of an ascending (iambic-anapaestic) rhythm were especially
favoured, as might be expected from the fact that the Middle English
alliterative line in the preceding centuries usually begins with one or
two unaccented syllables before the first accented one.</p>

<p>Of the different types used in the Middle English alliterative line type
C (C1), which does not harmonize well with the even-beat tendency of
the rhythm, and which is only very seldom if at all to be met with even
in the <cite>Coventry Plays</cite>, becomes very rare and tends to disappear
altogether, type A (A1) and (although<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_110" id="Pg_110" title="110"></a> these are much less frequent)
type B C (B C1) alone remaining in use.</p>

<p><a name="section68" id="section68"></a>
§ <b>68.</b> Of the more easily accessible pieces of Bishop John Bale
(1495&ndash;1563) his <cite>Comedye Concernynge Thre Lawes</cite>, edited by A. Schröer
(<cite>Anglia</cite>, v, pp. 137 ff., also separately, Halle, Niemeyer, 1882) is
written in two-beat short lines and four-beat long lines, and his <cite>King
Johan</cite> (c. 1548) (edited by Collier, Camden Society, 1838) entirely in
this latter metre. The latter play has a peculiar interest of its own,
containing as it does lines which, as in two Old English poems (cf. pp.
123, 124), consist either half or entirely of Latin words. Now, as the
accentuation of the Latin lines or half-lines admits of no uncertainty,
the four-beat scansion of the English verses of this play and of the
long lines in <cite>The Three Lawes</cite> is put beyond doubt, though Schröer
considers the latter as eight-beat long lines on the basis of the
four-beat theory of the short line.</p>

<p>Some specimens may serve to illustrate the nature of these ‘macaronic’
verses, e.g.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">A péna et <b>c</b>úlpa | I desíre to be <b>c</b>lére. <span class="attrib">p. 33.</span></div>
    <div class="line">In nómine pátris, | of all that éver I hárd.<span class="attrib">p. 28.</span></div>
    <div class="line">Iudicáte pupíllo, | deféndite víduam.<span class="attrib">p. 6.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Other verses of the same kind occur, pp. 5, 6, 53, 62, 78, 92.</p>

<p>But apart from this irrefutable proof of the four-beat scansion of the
long line, the rhythmic congruity of it with the rhyming alliterative
lines discussed in <a href="#section67">§ 67</a> can easily be demonstrated by the reoccurrence
of the same types, although a difference between the first and the
second hemistich no longer seems to exist.</p>

<p>Type A, of course, is the most frequent, and occurs in many sub-types,
which are distinguished chiefly by monosyllabic, disyllabic, or
polysyllabic anacruses, disyllabic or polysyllabic theses between the
first and second arsis, and monosyllabic, disyllabic, or trisyllabic
theses after the latter. The most usual form of this type corresponds
to the scheme <span class="scansion">(×)×–́××–́×</span>, while the form <span class="scansion">–́××–́×</span> is rarer.
Type A<sub>1</sub> likewise admits of polysyllabic anacruses and theses,
corresponding mostly to the formula <span class="scansion">(×)×–́××–́</span>, less frequently to
<span class="scansion">–́××–́</span>. Type B C <span class="scansion">(×)××–́×–́×</span> is rare, type B C<sub>1</sub> <span class="scansion">(×)××–́×–́</span>,
on the other hand, very common; type C <span class="scansion">(×)××–́–́×</span> still occurs
now and then, but type C<sub>1</sub> <span class="scansion">(×)××–́–́</span> has become exceedingly scarce.</p>

§ <b>69.</b> Statistical investigations as to the frequency of occur<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_111" id="Pg_111" title="111"></a>rence,
and especially on the grouping of these different types are still
wanting, and would contribute greatly toward the more exact knowledge of
the development of the iambic-anapaestic and the trochaic-dactylic metre
out of the four-beat verse. Of course in such an investigation the use
of anacrusis in the types A and A<sub>1</sub> should not be neglected. According
to the presence or absence of anacrusis in the two hemistichs four
different kinds of line may be distinguished:</p>

<p>1. Lines with anacrusis in both hemistichs. These are the most numerous
of all, and are chiefly represented by the combinations of types A(A<sub>1</sub>)

<p>The numerical preponderance of types A + A<sub>1</sub> is at once perceptible, and
usually these two types of hemistichs are combined in this order to form
a long line.</p>

<p>The result is that in the course of time whole passages made up of lines
of the same rhythmical structure (A + A<sub>1</sub>) are common in the dramatic
poetry of this period, as e.g. in the Prologue to <cite>Gammer Gurton’s
Needle</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">As Gámmer Gúrton, with mánye a wýde stítch,</div>
    <div class="line">Sat pésynge and pátching of Hódg her mans bríche,</div>
    <div class="line">By chánce or misfórtune, as shée her gear tóst,</div>
    <div class="line">In Hódge lether brýches her néedle shee lóst.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Possibly this preference of the type A<sub>1</sub> in the second half line may
go back to the influence of the difference between the rhythmical
structure of the first and the second hemistich of the alliterative line
in early Middle English poetry.</p>

<p><a name="section70" id="section70"></a>
§ <b>70.</b> This view derives additional probability from the manner
in which lines rhythmically identical with the alliterative hemistich
are combined into certain forms of stanza which are used
in the above-mentioned dramatic poems, especially in Bale’s
<cite>Three Lawes</cite>.</p>

<p>For in this play those halves of tail-rhyme stanzas, which<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_114" id="Pg_114" title="114"></a> form the
‘wheels’ of the alliterative-rhyming stanzas previously described (§§ 61
and 66) as used in narrative poetry and in the mysteries, are completed
so as to form entire tail-rhyme stanzas (of six or eight lines) similar
to those mentioned in § 65. This will be evident from the following
examples:</p>

<p>The difference in rhythm which we have previously pointed out between
the lines of the body of the stanza (corresponding to first halves of
the alliterative line) and those of the tail (corresponding to second
halves) may again be observed in most of the stanzas of this play,
although not in all of them.</p>

<p>In other passages the sequence of rhymes is less regular; e.g. in ll.
190&ndash;209, which rhyme according to the formulas <em>a a a b c c b</em>, <em>d d b e
e b</em>, <em>e e e f g g f</em></p>

<p><a name="section71" id="section71"></a>
§ <b>71.</b> Lastly, we must mention another kind of verse or stave
originating in the resolution of the four-beat alliterative line into
two sections, and their combination so as to form irregular tail-rhyme
stanzas, viz. the so-called Skeltonic verse. This kind of verse,
however, was not invented (as is erroneously stated in several Histories
of English Literature) by Skelton, but existed before him, as is evident
from the preceding remarks. The name came to be given to the metre from
the fact that Skelton, poet laureate of King Henry VII, was fond of this
metre, and used it for several popular poems.</p>

<p>In Skelton’s metre the strict form of the alliterative four-beat line
has arrived at the same stage of development which the freer form had
reached about three hundred years earlier in<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_115" id="Pg_115" title="115"></a> Layamon’s <cite>Brut</cite>, and
afterwards in <cite>King Horn</cite>. That is to say, in Skelton’s metre the long
line is broken up by sectional rhyme into two short ones. The first
specimens of this verse which occur in the <cite>Towneley Mysteries</cite>, in the
<cite>Chester Plays</cite>, and in some of the Moralities, e.g. in <cite>The World and
the Child</cite> (Dodsl. i), resemble Layamon’s verse in so far as long lines
(without sectional rhymes) and short rhyming half-lines occur in one and
the same passage. On the other hand, they differ from it and approach
nearer to the strophic form of the alliterative line (as occurring in
the Miracle Plays) in that the short lines do not rhyme in couplets, but
in a different and varied order of rhyme, mostly <cite>a b a b</cite>; cf. the
following passage (l. c., p. 247):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Ha, há, now Lúst and Líking is my náme.</div>
    <div class="line">Í am <b>f</b>résh as <b>f</b>lówers in Máy,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>In Skelton’s <cite>Magnificence</cite> the short lines rhyme in couplets like those
of <cite>King Horn</cite>, in a passage taken from p. 257 (part of which may be
quoted here):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Nowe lét me se abóut,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_116" id="Pg_116" title="116"></a></p>

<p>In other poems Skelton uses short lines of two beats, but rhyming in a
varied order under the influence, it would seem, of the strophic system
of the virelay, which rhymes in the order <em>a a a b b b b c c c c d</em>. But
the succession of rhymes is more irregular in the Skeltonic metre, as e.
g. in the passage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">What cán it auáyle</div>
    <div class="line">To drýue fórth a snáyle,</div>

    <div class="line">Of an hérynges táyle;</div>

    <div class="line">To wrýte or to endýte,</div>

    <div class="line">Of dívers maner stýle,<span class="normal">&amp;c.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="attribution">Colin Cloute (i. 311).</div>

<p>In other cases short bob-lines of one beat only interchange with
two-beat rhythms, as e.g. in Skelton’s poem <cite>Caudatos Anglos</cite> (i. 193):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Gup, Scót,</div>
    <div class="line">Ye blót:</div>
    <div class="line">Laudáte</div>
    <div class="line">Caudáte,</div>
    <div class="line">Sét in bétter</div>
    <div class="line">Thy péntaméter.</div>
    <div class="line">This Dúndás,</div>
    <div class="line">This Scóttishe ás,</div>
    <div class="line">He rýmes and ráyles</div>
    <div class="line">That Énglishman have táyles.</div>
    <div class="line">Skeltónus laureátus,</div>
    <div class="line">Ánglicus nátus,</div>

    <div class="line">Úndique nótum,<span class="normal">&amp;c.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The mingling of Latin and English lines, as in this passage, is one of
the characteristic features of the Skeltonic verse.</p>

<p>In some passages, as e.g. in the humorous poems <cite>Phyllyp Sparowe</cite> and
<cite>Elinour Rummyng</cite>, the three-beat rhythm seems to prevail. In such cases
it probably developed out of the two-beat rhythm in the same way as in
<cite>King Horn</cite>.</p>

<p>Skelton’s verse was chiefly used by poets of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries for satirical and burlesque poetry. One of its
chief cultivators was John Taylor, the Water-poet. A list of Skeltonic
poems is given in Dyce’s edition of Skelton’s poems, i. introduction,
pp. cxxviii-cxxix.</p>


<h4>C. Revival of the old four-beat alliterative verse
      in the Modern English period.</h4>

<p><a name="section72" id="section72"></a>
§ <b>72.</b> If after what precedes any doubt were possible as to
the scansion of the verses quoted on p. 113 from the Prologue
to the Early Modern English comedy of <cite>Gammer Gurton’s
Needle</cite>, this doubt would be removed at once by the following
couplet and by the accents put over the second line of it by the
sixteenth-century metrician, George Gascoigne<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">No <b>w</b>ight in this <b>w</b>orld | that <b>w</b>ealth can attayne,</div>
    <div class="line">Unlésse hè bèléve | thàt áll ìs bùt váyne.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>For the rhythm of these lines is perfectly identical with that of the
lines of the above-mentioned prologue, and also with that of the
alliterative line quoted ten years later (<span class="fakesc">A. D.</span> 1585), and called
tumbling-verse by King James VI in his <cite>Revlis and Cavtelis</cite>, viz.:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Fetching fúde for to féid it | fast fúrth of the Fárie.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This is the very same rhythm in which a good many songs and ballads of
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries are written, as e.g. the
well-known ballad of <cite>King John and the Abbot of Canterbury</cite>, which
begins with the following stanzas<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_118" id="Pg_118" title="118"></a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

      <div class="line">And he rúled Éngland | with máine and with míght,</div>
      <div class="line">For he díd great wróng, | and maintéin’d little ríght.</div>

      <div class="line">They rode póst for him | to faire Lóndon tówne.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This four-beat rhythm, which (as is proved by the definition King James
VI gives of it) is the direct descendant of the old alliterative line,
has continued in use in modern English poetry to the present day.</p>

<p>It occurs in the poem <cite>The recured Lover</cite>, by Sir Thomas Wyatt, one of
the earliest Modern English poets, where it is intermixed sometimes with
four-feet rhythms, as was the case also in several Early English poems.
The general rhythm, however, is clearly of an iambic-anapaestic nature.
Fifteen years after the death of Wyatt Thomas Tusser wrote part of his
didactic poem <cite>A hundred good points of Husbandry</cite> in the same metre. In
Tusser’s hands the metre is very regular, the first foot generally being
an iambus and the following feet anapaests:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Whom fáncy persuádeth | amóng other cróps,</div>
    <div class="line">To háve for his spénding, | suffícient of hóps,</div>
    <div class="line">Must wíllingly fóllow, | of chóices to chóose.</div>
    <div class="line">Such léssons appróved, | as skílful do úse.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The four beats of the rhythm and the regular occurrence of the caesura
are as marked characteristics of these verses as of the earlier
specimens of the metre.</p>

<p>Spenser has written several eclogues of his <cite>Shepheard’s Calendar</cite> in
this metre (February, May, September), and Shakespeare uses it in some
lyric pieces of his <cite>King Henry IV</cite>, Part II, but also for dialogues, as
e.g. <cite>Err.</cite> <span class="fakesc">III.</span> i. 11&ndash;84. In more modern times Matthew Prior
(1664&ndash;1715) wrote a ballad <cite>Down Hall</cite> to the tune, as he says, of <cite>King
John and the Abbot of Canterbury</cite>, which clearly shows that he meant to
imitate the ancient popular four-beat rhythm, which he did with perfect
success. In other poems he used it for stanzas rhyming in the order <em>a b
a b</em>.<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_119" id="Pg_119" title="119"></a> Swift has used the same metre, and it became very popular in
Scottish poetry through Allan Ramsay and Robert Burns, one of whose most
famous poems is written in it, viz.:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">My héart’s in the Híghlands, | my héart is not hére;</div>
    <div class="line">My héart’s in the Híghlands, | a-chásing the déer;</div>
    <div class="line">Chásing the wíld deer | and fóllowing the róe,</div>
    <div class="line">My héart’s in the Híghlands | wheréver I gó.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Sir Walter Scott used it frequently for drinking-songs, and Thomas Moore
wrote his <cite>Letters of the Fudge Family</cite> in it.</p>

<p>By Coleridge and Byron this metre was used in the same way as by Wyatt,
viz. intermixed with regular four-foot verse according to the subject,
the four-beat iambic-anapaestic rhythm for livelier passages, the pure
iambic for passages of narration and reflecti&mdash;. Byron’s <cite>Prisoner of
Chillon</cite> and his <cite>Siege of Corinth</cite> are good specimens of this kind of
metre.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> On the other hand the regular four-foot rhythm, as will be
shown below, if it is of a looser structure, develops into a kind of
verse similar to the iambic-anapaestic rhythm&mdash;an additional reason for
their existing side by side often in one poem.</p>

<p>A few variations of this metre remain to be mentioned, which occur as
early as Tusser. The first variety arises from interlaced rhyme, by
which the two four-beat verses are broken up into four two-beat verses
rhyming in the order <em>a b a b</em>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">If húsbandry brággeth</div>
    <div class="line">To gó with the bést,</div>
    <div class="line">Good húsbandry bággeth</div>
    <div class="line">Up góld in his chést.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>On the model of these stanzas others were afterwards formed by Tusser
consisting of three-beat verses of the same rhythm. The same verse was
used for eight-line stanzas rhyming <em>a b a b c d c d</em> by Nicholas Rowe,
Shenstone, Cowper, and in later times by Thackeray in one of his
burlesque poems (<cite>Malony’s Lament</cite> in <cite>Ballads</cite>, <cite>the Rose and the
Ring</cite>, &amp;c., p. 225). For examples of these variations see the sections
treating of the iambic-anapaestic verses of three and two measures.</p>

<p><a name="section73" id="section73"></a>
§ <b>73.</b> In modern times a few attempts have been made to revive the old
four-beat alliterative line without rhyme, but also without a regular
use of alliteration. These attempts, however, have never become
popular.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_120" id="Pg_120" title="120"></a></p>

<p>The following passage from William Morris’s dramatic poem <cite>Love is
enough</cite> may give an idea of the structure of this kind of verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Fáir Master <b>Ó</b>liver, | thóu who at <b>á</b>ll times</div>
    <div class="line">Mayst <b>ó</b>pen thy héart | to our lórd and máster,</div>
    <div class="line"><b>T</b>éll us what <b>t</b>ídings | thou hást to delíver;</div>
    <div class="line">For our <b>h</b>éarts are grown <b>h</b>éavy, | and whére shall we túrn to,</div>
    <div class="line">If thús the king’s <b>g</b>lóry, | our <b>g</b>áin and salvátion,</div>
    <div class="line">Must <b>g</b>ó down the wínd | amid <b>g</b>lóom and despáiring.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The rhythm, together with the irregular use of alliteration, places
these four-beat alliterative lines on the same level with those of the
dramatic poems of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.</p>

<p>The same kind of versification is found in Longfellow’s translation of
the late Old English poem on <cite>The Grave</cite>, and in James M. Garnett’s
translations of <cite>Beowulf</cite> and Cynewulf’s <cite>Elene</cite>. On the other hand,
George Stephens, in his translation of the Old English poem on <cite>The
Phoenix</cite>, published 1844, not only adheres strictly to the laws of
alliteration, but confines himself to Germanic words, sometimes even
using inflexional forms peculiar to Middle English.</p>

<p><a name="section74" id="section74"></a>
§ <b>74.</b> We shall conclude this survey of the development of the
four-beat alliterative line by giving a series of examples in reversed
chronological order, beginning with writers of the present day and
ending with the earliest remains of Old English poetry, in order to
illustrate the identity in rhythmic structure of this metre in all
periods of its history.</p>

<p><a name="section75" id="section75"></a>
§ <b>75.</b> The evidence contained in this chapter, with regard to the
continuous survival, in its essential rhythmical features, of the Old
English native verse down to modern times, may be briefly summed up as
<span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. In the oldest remains of English poetry (<cite>Beowulf</cite>, <cite>Elene</cite>,
<cite>Andreas</cite>, <cite>Judith</cite>, <cite>Phoenix</cite>, &amp;c.) we already find lines with combined
alliteration and rhyme intermixed with, and rhythmically equivalent to,
the purely alliterative lines, exactly as we do in late Old English and
early Middle English poems such as <cite>Byrhtnoth</cite>, <cite>Be Dōmes Dæge</cite>,
<cite>Oratio Poetica</cite>, <cite>Chronicle</cite> an. 1036, <cite>Proverbs of Alfred</cite>, and
Layamon’s <cite>Brut</cite>.</p>

<p>2. In some of these poems, viz. the <cite>Phoenix</cite> and the <cite>Oratio Poetica</cite>,
Latin two-beat hemistichs are combined with English hemistichs of
similar rhythm to form regular long lines, just as is done in Bale’s
play of <cite>Kinge Johan</cite> (sixteenth century).</p>

<p>3. The lines of this play agree in the general principle, and frequently
in the details of their rhythmical structure, with alliterative-rhyming
long lines which occur in lyric and epic poems of the same period, and
which two contemporary metrists, Gascoigne and King James VI, recognized
(independently of each other) as lines of four accents.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_125" id="Pg_125" title="125"></a></p>

<p>4. The rhythm of these sixteenth-century lines is indistinguishable from
that of a four-accent metre which is popular in English and German
poetry down to the present day.</p>

<p>These facts appear to leave no room for doubt that the Germanic metre
has had a continuous history in English poetry from the earliest times
down to the present, and that the long line, in Old and Middle English
as in Modern English, had four accents (two in each hemistich). The
proof acquires additional force from the fact, established by recent
investigations, that the most important of the metrical types of the Old
English hemistich are found again in Middle and Modern English poetry.</p>

<h2>PART II. FOREIGN METRES</h2>
<h3>DIVISION I. <span class="smcap">The Foreign Metres in General</span><br />
CHAPTER V. INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p><a name="section76" id="section76"></a>
§ <b>76.</b> It was not till about 150 years after the Norman Conquest that
foreign metres were introduced in English literature under the influence
of French and Low Latin versification. For these, too, the general law
observed in all accentual poetry holds good, viz. that the word-accent
and the syntactical accent must coincide with the rhythmical accent.
This rule, however, was easier to observe in the old native four-beat
alliterative metre, in which the proportion and order of accented and
unaccented syllables admit of many variations, than in metres consisting
of equal measures, which follow stricter rules in that respect. In the
older native verse accordingly we seldom find deviations from this
fundamental rule, whereas in the newer foreign metres they are more
frequent and striking.</p>

<p>The ordinary native alliterative metre was founded, as we have seen, on
the principle that four accented syllables had to occur in each long
line, together with an undefined number of unaccented ones, the position
and order of those different syllables admitting many variations. The
new metres constructed on foreign models during the Middle English
period differ from the earlier rhythmic forms by the regularity of the
alternation of unaccented and accented syllables and by the uniformity
of their feet or measures; they are accordingly styled even-measured or
even-beat verses.</p>

<p>Four different kinds are to be distinguished, viz. ascending and
descending disyllabic measures, and ascending and descending trisyllabic
measures, commonly called <em>iambic</em>, <em>trochaic</em>, <em>anapaestic</em>, and
<em>dactylic</em> measures. In Middle English poetry, however, only iambic
rhythms were used. The three other kinds of rhythms did not come in till
the beginning of the Modern English period.</p>

<p>With regard to the development of various even-measured rhythms from
these four different kinds of feet, it will suffice<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_127" id="Pg_127" title="127"></a> to consider the
iambic and trochaic metres only, as these are the most important, and
the formation of the anapaestic and the dactylic metres is to be
explained in the same way.</p>

<p><a name="section77" id="section77"></a>
§ <b>77.</b> According to the number of feet we may classify <b>the different
kinds of line</b>&mdash;retaining the classical nomenclature&mdash;as dimeters,
trimeters, tetrameters, &amp;c.; (one meter always consisting of <em>two</em>
iambic or trochaic, or anapaestic feet), so that, for instance, an
iambic tetrameter contains eight iambic feet. Lines or rhythmical
sections consisting of complete feet, i.e. of an equal number of
accented and unaccented syllables, are called <em>acatalectic</em> or
<em>complete</em> lines (dimeters, trimeters, &amp;c.). If, however, the last foot
of a line or of a rhythmical section be characterized by the omission of
the last syllable, i.e. by a pause, the line is called <em>catalectic</em> or
<em>incomplete</em>. The following examples will serve to illustrate the
meaning of these terms:</p>

<p>These are the principal forms of rhythmical sections made up

English Poetry.</p>

<p><a name="section78" id="section78"></a>
§ <b>78. The breaking up of these long lines</b> (consisting of two
rhythmical sections) into shorter lines is usually effected by rhyme.
Thus, if both rhythmical sections of the acatalectic tetrameter are
divided by what is called leonine rhyme we get the short four-foot
couplet imitated from the French <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vers octosyllabe</em>, as in the
following verses taken from the Middle English <cite>A lutel soth sermon</cite>
(ll. 17&ndash;20):</p>

<p>Another stanza of four lines is formed when the first rhythmical

corresponding place (viz. before the caesura) by another species of
rhyme, called <em>interlaced</em> or <em>crossed</em> rhyme (<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rime entrelacée</em>):</p>

<p>Corresponding short trochaic lines result from the acatalectic trochaic
tetrameter broken by leonine or inserted rhyme. In Middle English
poetry, however, they occur but very seldom in their pure form, i.e.
with disyllabic rhymes; in most cases they have monosyllabic or
alternate monosyllabic and disyllabic rhymes.</p>

<p>In like manner the catalectic iambic tetrameter is broken up by inserted
rhyme into two short verses, viz. one of four feet with a monosyllabic

§ <b>79.</b> In the fourteenth century the <b>heroic verse</b> was added to these
Middle English metres; a rhyming iambic line of five feet, formed after
the model of the French line of ten syllables, e.g.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">A kníght ther wás, | and thát a wórthy mán.</div>
      <div class="attribution">Chaucer, Prol. 43.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Finally, the verse used in the <b>tail-rhyme staves</b> (<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rime couée</em>) must
be mentioned. As this verse, however, usually appears only in that form
in which it is broken up into three short ones which compose one half of
the stave, its origin will be more properly discussed in the second
Book, treating of the origin and form of the different stanzas. To begin
with, however, it was simply a long line of three rhythmical sections.
Indications of this are here and there found in the way in which it is
arranged in MSS. and early printed books, e.g. in the first version of
the <cite>Legend of Alexius</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> where it is written in triple columns on
the large folio pages of the Vernon MS. in the Bodleian Library:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
     <div class="line">Sítteþ stílle withóuten stríf, | And Í will télle yóu the líf |

     <div class="line">Álex wás his ríght náme, | To sérve gód thought hím no sháme, |
              Therof néver hé ne blán.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a name="section80" id="section80"></a>
§ <b>80.</b> These are the simplest forms of verse used in Middle English
poetry; they can be varied, however, in many ways. First, they are not
restricted to monosyllabic or masculine endings or rhymes, but like
their French models, admit also of disyllabic or feminine rhymes.
Further, the caesura, where it occurs at all, may be masculine as well
as feminine. The septenary line, however, in its strict form admits only
of monosyllabic caesura and disyllabic ending.</p>

<p>Caesura and rhyme are in this respect closely analogous. For the
difference between the two kinds of caesura and between the two kinds of
rhyme is, that in the case of a masculine caesura or rhyme the pause
occurs immediately after the last accented<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_132" id="Pg_132" title="132"></a> syllable of the rhythmical
section, whereas in the case of a feminine caesura or rhyme an
unaccented syllable (sometimes even two or more unaccented
syllables<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>) follows upon the last accented one before the pause
takes place. Combinations of masculine caesura with masculine or with
feminine line-endings or rhymes, or the reverse, are, of course, allowed
and of frequent occurrence.</p>

<p>We quote in the first place some Middle English and Modern English
examples of masculine caesura in the Septenary, in the Alexandrine, in
lines of five and of four measures and&mdash;for the sake of comparison&mdash;in
the four-beat verse:</p>

<div class="lines-container">

         <div class="attribution">Shakesp. 2 Hen. IV, v. iii. 36.</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Of the feminine caesura there are two different kinds, viz. the
so-called <em>Epic</em> and <em>Lyric</em> caesura.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> In the Epic caesura in Iambic
metre the pause occurs, as in the feminine rhyme, after a supernumerary
syllable which follows upon the last accented one of the section the
next iambic foot following upon it in the usual manner. In the Lyric
caesura in Iambic metre, on the other hand, the pause occurs within a
foot, i.e. after the regular unaccented syllable of an iambic foot.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_133" id="Pg_133" title="133"></a></p>

<p>These three different kinds of caesura may be more simply defined as
follows: In the ordinary iambic line the caesura occurring after a
regular unaccented syllable is a feminine Lyric one (thus: <span class="scansion">...⏑–́⏑|–́⏑–́...</span>);
the caesura occurring after an accented syllable is a masculine one (thus:
<span class="scansion">...⏑–́|⏑–́⏑–́...</span>); and that which occurs after a supernumerary
unaccented syllable immediately following upon an accented one is a feminine
Epic caesura (thus: <span class="scansion">...⏑–́⏑|⏑–́⏑–́...</span>).</p>

<p>These different kinds of caesura strictly correspond to their French
models. The Epic caesura, which to some extent disturbs the regular
rhythmic flow of a verse, is by far the least frequent in metres of
equal feet.</p>

<p>In the alliterative line, on the other hand, as this metre does not
consist of equal feet, the feminine caesura, which is, from a rhythmical
point of view, identical with the Epic, is commonly used both in the Old
English and in the Middle English period, being produced by the natural
quality of the types A, C, D, and by the resolution of the last accented
syllable in the types B and D (of the Old English verse). For this
reason it also occurs more frequently than the other kinds of caesura in
the Modern English four-beat line.</p>

<p>This may be illustrated by the following examples:</p>

<p class="pad10">Epic caesura:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>All three kinds of caesura will have to be treated systematically later
on in connexion with the iambic rhyming verse of five measures, the
character of which they affect very much.</p>

<p><a name="section81" id="section81"></a>
§ <b>81.</b> The variety caused by the different kinds of caesura in the
structure of the metres of equal measures, formed on the principle of a
regular alternation of unaccented and accented syllables, is much
increased by other causes arising from the different nature of Romanic
and Germanic versification. These variations came into existence, partly
because the poets, in the<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_134" id="Pg_134" title="134"></a> early days of the employment of
equal-measured rhythms, found it difficult, owing to want of practice,
to secure the exact coincidence of the word-accent and the metrical
accent, partly because for linguistic or (in the case of the later
poets) for artistic reasons they considered it unnecessary to do so.
They therefore either simply suffered the discord between the two kinds
of accentuation to remain, or, in order to avoid it, permitted
themselves licences that did violence either to the rhythmic laws of the
verse itself, or to the customary pronunciation of the words as regards
the value of syllables (i.e. their being elided or fully sounded) or
word-accent.</p>

<p>The changes which the equal-measured rhythms have undergone and still
undergo from the causes mentioned thus have relation partly to the
rhythmic structure of the verse itself, partly to the value of
syllables, and partly to the word-accent. From these three points of
view we shall first consider the iambic equal-measured rhythm in general
(this being the only species used in Middle English, and the one which
in Modern English is of most frequent occurrence and influences all the
rest), before we proceed to examine its individual varieties.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_135" id="Pg_135" title="135"></a></p>
<h3>CHAPTER  VI<br />
<span class="subtitle">VERSE-RHYTHM</span></h3>

<p><a name="section82" id="section82"></a>
§ <b>82.</b> As in Greek and Latin metre, so also in the equal-measured
rhythms of Middle and Modern English, it is a general law that the
beginning or end of a metrical foot should, so far as possible, not
coincide with the beginning or end of a word, but should occur in the
middle, so that the individual feet may be more closely connected with
each other. When this law is not observed, there arises what is
technically called <em>diaeresis</em>, that is to say, the breaking up of the
line into separate portions, which as a rule renders the verse
inharmonious. On this account lines composed entirely of monosyllables
are to be avoided. This law is more frequently neglected in Modern
English poetry than in that of earlier times, because the rarity of
inflexional endings makes its constant observance difficult.</p>

<p>Even in Middle English poems, however, we often find lines, especially
if they are short, which are composed of monosyllabic words only.</p>

<p>These observations may be illustrated by the following examples:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Lines with diaeresis:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Ne ís no quéne so stárk ne stóur.</div>
      <div class="attribution">Wright’s Spec. of Lyr. Poetry, p. 87, l. 4.</div>

    <div class="line">And hé was clád in cóote and hóod of gréne.</div>

    <div class="line">Had cást him óut from Héaven with áll his hóst.</div>

    <div class="line">Had shóok his thróne. What thóugh the fíeld be lóst?</div>
      <div class="attribution">ib. 105.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Lines without diaeresis:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Nou shrínkeþ róse and lýlie flour.</div>
     <div class="attribution">Wright’s Spec. of Lyr. Poetry, p. 87, line 1.</div>

     <a class="pagenum" name="Pg_136" id="Pg_136" title="136"></a>

    <div class="line">And smále fówles máken mélodíe.</div>
      <div class="attribution">Chaucer, Prol. line 9.</div>

    <div class="line">And réassémbling óur afflícted pówers.</div>
      <div class="attribution">Milton, Parad. L. i. 186</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a name="section83" id="section83"></a>
§ <b>83.</b> With regard to modulation, too, the lines with diaeresis differ
from those without it. In lines with diaeresis all syllables or words
with a rhythmic accent upon them are pronounced with nearly the same
stress, while in lines without diaeresis the difference between the
accented syllables is more noticeable. The two following examples taken
from Milton’s <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> will serve to illustrate this, the
difference of stress being indicated by different numbers under the
accented syllables:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Had cást him óut from Héaven with áll his hóst</div>
    <div class="line">
         <span class="normal">&nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2</span></div>
    <div class="line">And réassémbling óur afflícted pówers.</div>
    <div class="line">
         <span class="normal">&nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; 2&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; 3&nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; 2</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>As a general rule, the syllables which stand in an arsis are, just
because they bear the metrical stress, of course more strongly accented
than those which stand in a thesis.</p>

<p>Occasionally, however, a thesis-syllable may be more strongly accented
than an arsis-syllable in the same line which only carries the
rhythmical accent, but neither the word-accent nor the logical accent of
the sentence.</p>

<p>Thus in the following line from <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><em>Irreconcileable to our grand Foe</em>,</p>

<p>the word <em>grand</em>, although it stands in a thesis, is certainly, because
of the rhetorical stress which it has, more strongly accented than the
preceding word <em>our</em> or the syllable <em>-ble</em>, both of which have the
rhythmical accent. Milton’s blank verse abounds in such resolved
discords, as they might be called. In not a few cases, however, they
remain unresolved. This occurs chiefly in lines where the short
unaccented syllables or unimportant monosyllabic words must be
lengthened beyond their natural quantity in order to fit in with the
rhythm of the verse, as in the following lines:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Of Thámuz yéarly wóunded: thé love-tále. <span class="attrib">Par. L. i. 452.</span></div>
    <div class="line">Únivérsal repróach far wórse to béar. <span class="attrib">Par. L. vi. 34.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>On the other hand long syllables standing in a thesis may be shortened
without harshness, e.g. the words <em>brought</em> and <em>our</em> in the following
line:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Brought déath intó the wórld and áll our wóe.</div>
  </div>
</div>


<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_137" id="Pg_137" title="137"></a></p>


<p><a name="section84" id="section84"></a>
§ <b>84.</b> With regard to the treatment of the rhythm the Middle English
even-beat metres in some respects are considerably different from the
Modern English metres, the reason being that the earlier poets, as yet
inexperienced in the art of composing in even-beat measures, found it
more difficult than Modern English poets to make the rhythmic accent
coincide with the word-accent and the syntactic-accent (cf. pp. 126&ndash;7,
134).</p>

<p>Certain deviations from the ordinary iambic rhythm which partly disturb
the agreement of the number of accented and unaccented syllables in a
line are more frequent in Middle English than in Modern English poetry.
One of these licences is the <b>suppression of the anacrusis</b> or the
absence of the first unaccented syllable of the line, or of the second
rhythmical section, e.g.</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">

  </div>
</div>

<p>While this metrical licence may mostly be attributed to want of
technical skill in Middle English poets, it is frequently employed in
the Modern English period, as the last example<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_138" id="Pg_138" title="138"></a> shows, with distinct
artistic intention of giving a special emphasis to a particular word.
Several Middle English poets, however, make but scant use of this
licence, e.g. the author of <cite>The Owl and the Nightingale</cite> and Gower,
while some of them, as Orm, never use it at all.</p>

<p><a name="section85" id="section85"></a>
§ <b>85.</b> These latter poets, on the other hand, make very frequent use of
another kind of rhythmical licence, viz. <b>level stress</b> or <em>hovering
accent</em>, as Dr. Gummere calls it; i.e. they subordinate the word-accent
or the syntactic accent to the rhythmic accent, and so far violate the
principal law of all accentual metre, which demands <em>that those three
accents should fall on one and the same syllable</em>.</p>

<p>This licence is found chiefly in metres of a certain length, e.g. in the
Septenary or in the iambic five-foot line, but not so frequently in
shorter metres, as the resulting interruption of the flow of the rhythm
is not so perceptible in long as in short lines.</p>

<p>The least sensible irregularity of this kind occurs when the
(syntactically) less emphatic of two consecutive monosyllabic words is
placed in the arsis, as in the following lines:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">For whý this ís more thén that cáuse is.
                          <span class="attrib">Chaucer, H. of Fame, 20.</span></div>

    <div class="line">Now seemeth féarful nó more thé dark cáve.<span class="attrib">ib. p. 210.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>If the accented syllable of a word consisting of two or more syllables
is placed in the thesis, and the unaccented one in the arsis, the
licence is greater. This is a licence often met with in Middle English
poetry, as e.g.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">

    <div class="line">I wílle not léyf you álle helpléss | as mén withóuten fréynd.</div>

</div>

<p>The effect is still more harsh, if inflexional endings are used in this
way, though this does not often occur. The following are examples:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_139" id="Pg_139" title="139"></a></p>

<div class="lines-container">

  </div>
</div>

<p>In most cases dissonant rhythmical accentuations of this sort are caused
by the rhyme, especially in Middle English poetry, e.g.:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Sównynge alwáy th’ encrés of his wynnýnge.</div>
    <div class="line">He wólde the sée were képt for ény thínge.</div>
       <div class="attribution">Chaucer, Prol. 275.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Cf. also: <em>thing</em>: <em>wr</em>i<em>t</em>ý<em>ng</em> ib. 325&ndash;6; <em>br</em>e<em>mst</em>óo<em>n</em>: <em>non</em> ib.
629&ndash;30; a<em>le-st</em>á<em>ke</em>: <em>cake</em> ib. 667&ndash;8; <em>g</em>o<em>dd</em>é<em>sse</em>: <em>gesse</em> Chaucer,
Knightes Tale, 243&ndash;4; <em>herde</em>: a<em>nsw</em>é<em>rde</em> ib. 265&ndash;6; <em>ass</em>e<em>mbl</em>ý<em>nge</em> :
<em>thynge</em> Barclay, Ship of Fools, p. 20; similar examples are even to be
met with in early Modern English poetry, e.g.: <em>n</em>o<em>th</em>í<em>ng</em>: <em>bring</em> Sur.
15; <em>bem</em>oa<em>n</em>í<em>ng</em>: <em>king</em> Wyatt, 206; <em>w</em>e<em>lf</em>á<em>re</em>: <em>snare</em> ib. 92;
<em>g</em>oo<em>dn</em>é<em>ss</em>: <em>accéss</em> ib. 209; <em>m</em>a<em>n</em>é<em>re</em>: <em>chere</em> Surrey, 124, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Sometimes it may be doubtful how a line should be scanned. In some cases
of this kind the usage of the poet will decide the question; we know,
for instance, that Orm never allows the omission of the first unaccented
syllable. Where decisive evidence of this kind is wanting, the verse
must be scanned in such a manner as to cause the least rhythmical
difficulty. If a compound, or a word containing a syllable with
secondary accent, does not fit in with the rhythmical accent, it is to
be read, as a rule, with level stress when it occurs in the middle of a
line (and, of course, always when it is the rhyme-word). On the other
hand, if according to the rhythmical scheme of the line an unaccented
syllable would be the bearer of the rhythmical stress, we must in most
cases assume suppression of the anacrusis.</p>

<p>It would not be admissible therefore to scan:</p>

<div class="iline">Love, thát l<span class="normal">i</span>v<span class="normal">é</span>th | and réigneth ín my thóught, <span class="attrib">Surrey, p. 12.</span></div>

<p>but:</p>

<div class="iline">Lóve that líveth | and réigneth ín my thóught.</div>

<p>The licence of displacement of accent is an offence against the
fundamental law of accentual verse, and therefore becomes more and more
rare as the technique of verse becomes more perfect.</p>

<p><a name="section86" id="section86"></a>
§ <b>86.</b> Another metrical licence, which is not inadmissible, is
<b>the absence of a thesis in the interior of a line</b>. This<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_140" id="Pg_140" title="140"></a>
licence is not of the same origin in Middle English as in Modern
English poetry.</p>

<p>In Middle English it generally appears to be a relic of the
ancient alliterative verse (Types C and D) and to be analogous
to the similar usage of the contemporary Middle English alliterative
line, as e.g.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Ne léve nó mán to múchel | to chílde ne to wíue.</div>
    <div class="attribution">Moral Ode, line 24.</div>

    <div class="line">Þet ís al sóth fúl iwís. <span class="attrib">Pater Noster, 2.</span></div>

    <div class="line">hálde wé gódes láȝe. <span class="attrib">ib. 21.</span></div>

    <div class="line">Óf the próphéte | that hátte Séynt Iohán.

  </div>
</div>

<p>Not unfrequently, also, this licence is caused by the rhyme, as in the
following examples:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Myd Hárald Árfáger, | kýng of Nórthwéy: eye.</div>
       <div class="attribution">Rob. of Glouc. 22.</div>

    <div class="line">As wás king Róbert of Scótlánd: hand.

    <div class="line">Súmwhat óf his clóþíng: king.</div>
       <div class="attribution">Rob. Mannyng, Handlyng Sinne, l. 5703.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The same manner of treatment may be found applied to words which end in
<em>-lyng</em>, <em>-esse</em>, <em>-nesse</em>, and similar syllables, and which have a
secondary accent on the last syllable and the chief accent on the
preceding root-syllable.</p>

<p>In Modern English verse the absence of a thesis between two accented
syllables sometimes arises from phonetic conditions, i.e. from the pause
which naturally takes place between two words which it is difficult to
pronounce successively. This pause supplies the place of the missing
thesis, as e.g. in the following lines:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">And fírst cléns us fróm the fíend. <span class="attrib">Townl. Myst. p. 9.</span></div>

    <div class="line">And scórn the Stóry | thát the Kníght tóld. <span class="attrib">Wyatt, p. 192.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In other instances the emphasis laid upon a particular word compensates
for the absence of the unaccented syllable, especially, if the accented
syllable is long: e.g.</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">And thóu, Fáther, |  recéive intó thy hánds. <span class="attrib">Surrey, p. 142.</span></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>This licence is of frequent occurrence in even-beat measures.</p>

<p><a name="section87" id="section87"></a>
§ <b>87.</b> Another metrical peculiarity caused by the influence of the
rhythm is the <b>lengthening</b> of a word by the introduction of an
unaccented extra syllable, commonly an <em>e</em>, to supply a thesis lacking
between two accented syllables.</p>

<p>This occurs in Middle English and in Modern English poetry also. (i) In
disyllabic words, commonly those with a first syllable ending with a mute,
the second beginning with a liquid, e.g.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Of Éng(e)lónd | to Cáunterbúry they wénde. <span class="attrib">Chauc. Prol. 16.</span></div>

         <div class="attribution">Shakesp. All’s Well, <span class="fakesc">III.</span> v. 43.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>(ii) In Modern English poetry only in certain monosyllabic words ending
in <em>r</em> or <em>re</em>, preceded by a diphthong, as e.g. in <em>our</em>, <em>hour</em>,
<em>fire</em>, &amp;c., e.g.:</p>

<div class="iline">So dóth he féel | his fíre mánifóld. <span class="attrib">Wyatt, 205.</span></div>

<p>This peculiarity will be mentioned again in the next chapter.</p>

<p><a name="section88" id="section88"></a>
§ <b>88.</b> Another deviation from the regular iambic line is the <b>inversion
of the rhythm</b>; i.e. the substitution of a trochee for an iambus at the
beginning of a line or after the caesura. The rhythmical effect of this
licence has some resemblance to that of the suppression of anacrusis. In
both cases the rhythmic accent has to yield to the word-accent. But
while in the latter case the whole verse becomes trochaic in consequence
of the omission of the first syllable, in the former the trochaic
cadence affects one foot only (generally the first), the rest of the
verse being of a regular iambic rhythm. Hence the number of syllables in
each line is the same as that in all the other regular lines (including
those with level stress), whereas verses with suppressed anacrusis may
easily be distinguished from the former by their smaller number of
syllables. On the other hand, the number of syllables (being the same in
both cases) affords no help in distinguishing between change of
word-accent and inversion of rhythm. Which of these two kinds of licence
is to be recognized in any particular case can be determined only by the
position which the abnormal foot occupies in the line. Inversion of
rhythm (i.e. the substitution<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_142" id="Pg_142" title="142"></a> of a trochee for an iambus) occurs, as a
rule, only at the beginning of a line or hemistich, where the flow of
the rhythm has not begun, so that the introduction of a trochee does not
disturb it. If, therefore, the discord between normal word-stress and
iambic rhythm occurs in any other position in the line, it must be
regarded as a case of level stress.</p>

<p>The following examples will serve to illustrate the difference between
these three species of metrical licence:</p>

<p>Omission of anacrusis:</p>

<table width="90%" summary="anacrusis">
  <tr><td class="tdl ital">Herknet tó me góde men.  <span class="attrib">Hav. 1.</span></td><td class="tdl">&nbsp;7 syll.</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="tdl ital">Nórfolk sprúng thee, Lámbeth hólds thee déad.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="tdr">Surrey, p. 62.</td><td class="tdl">&nbsp;9 &nbsp;”</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Level stress:</p>

<table width="90%" summary="level stress">
  <tr><td class="tdl ital">A stálw<span class="normal">o</span>rþí man ín a flok.<span class="attrib">Hav. 24.</span></td><td class="tdl">&nbsp;8&nbsp; ”</td></tr>

  <tr><td class="tdr">Surrey, p. 126.</td><td class="tdl">10 &nbsp;”</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Inversion of rhythm:</p>

<table width="90%" summary="inversion of rhythm">
  <tr><td class="tdl ital">Míchel was súch a kíng to préyse. <span class="attrib">Hav. 60.</span></td><td class="tdl">&nbsp;8 &nbsp;”</td></tr>

  <tr><td class="tdl ital">Míldly doth flów alóng the frúitful fíelds.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="tdr">Surrey, p. 145.</td><td class="tdl">10  &nbsp;”</td></tr>

  <tr><td class="tdl ital">Shróuding themsélves únder the désert shóre.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="tdr">Surrey, p. 113.</td><td class="tdl">10 &nbsp;”</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Inversion of rhythm may be caused in the interior of a rhythmical series
only when a particularly strong emphasis is laid upon a word, e.g. to
express an antithesis or for similar reasons:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">That íf <span class="normal">góld ruste</span> | whát shal ýren dó?</div>
       <div class="attribution">Chaucer, Prol. 500.</div>

    <div class="line">And wé’ll <span class="normal">nót fail</span> | When Dúncan ís asléep.</div>
       <div class="attribution">Shakesp. Macb. <span class="fakesc">I.</span> vii. 61.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>We may distinguish between two kinds of inversion of rhythm, viz. (i)
<em>natural</em> inversion, and (2) <em>rhetorical</em> inversion. The former is
caused by word-accent, the latter by the rhetorical accent, as
illustrated by the last examples. The second kind differs very clearly
from level stress, as the word in question or the first syllable of it
(see the second line of the following quotation) is to be uttered with
an unusually strong emphasis, e.g.:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_143" id="Pg_143" title="143"></a></p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><span class="normal">Síck, or</span> in héalth, | in évil fáme or góod. <span class="attrib">Surrey, p. 17.</span></div>
    <div class="line"><span class="normal">Lústy</span> of scháip, <span class="normal">lýght of</span> delíveránce.</div>
    <div class="attribution">Dunbar, Thriss. and Rois 95.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In the second example inversion of rhythm occurs (as it often does)
twice over, viz. at the beginning of the verse and after the caesura.</p>

<p>Not unfrequently also two inversions of rhythm follow immediately upon
one another, e.g.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
     <div class="line"><span class="normal">Wórldly gládnes</span> | is mélled wíth affráy.</div>
     <div class="attribution">Lydgate, Min. Poems, xxii, line 11.</div>
     <div class="line"><span class="normal">Réigned óver</span> | so mány péoples and réalms. <span class="attrib">Surrey, p. 135.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Such verses, however, may also be looked upon as instances of the
omission of anacrusis combined with epic caesura.</p>

<p>This would be the only admissible explanation in verses the first
accented word of which is a word which usually does not bear an accent
or is not accented rhetorically, e.g.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Óf the wórdes | that Týdeús had sáid.</div>
       <div class="attribution">Lydgate, St. of Thebes, line 1082.</div>
    <div class="line">Tó have líved | áfter the cíty táken. <span class="attrib">Surrey, p. 139.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But in a line with an emphasized first word inversion of rhythm is the
more probable explanation: e.g.</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Nát astónned, | nor ín his hérte afférde.</div>
       <div class="attribution">Lydgate, St. of Thebes, line 1069.</div>
    <div class="line">Gód, that séndeth, | withdráweth wínter shárp. <span class="attrib">Surrey, p. 58..</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a name="section89" id="section89"></a>
§ <b>89. Disyllabic or polysyllabic thesis.</b> Another important deviation
from the regular iambic rhythm, which is clearly to be distinguished
from the double thesis caused by inversion of rhythm, consists in the
use of two or sometimes even more unaccented syllables instead of one to
form a regular thesis of a verse. This irregularity, which is almost as
common in Modern English as it is in Early English poetry, may occur in
any part of the verse. If it occurs in the first foot, it may be called
disyllabic or polysyllabic anacrusis, as in the following examples:</p>

<div class="lines-container">

       <div class="attribution">Coleridge, Anc. Mar. l. 3.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This metrical licence may occur also immediately after the caesura,
e.g.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Wel láte he léteþ úfel wéorc | þe hit né may dón na máre.</div>

       <div class="attribution">Shakesp. 1 Hen. VI, <span class="fakesc">I.</span> iv. 111.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It most frequently occurs, however, in the interior of the rhythmical
sections, and there it is found in any of the feet, except the last, as
will be seen by the following examples:</p>

<div class="lines-container">

<p><a name="section90" id="section90"></a>
§ <b>90.</b> Unaccented extra syllables are found also before a caesura or at
the end of the line. In the former case they constitute what is known as
<em>epic caesura</em>, in the latter they form feminine or double endings (if
there is only one extra syllable) or tumbling endings (if there are two
extra syllables). In both cases this irregularity is softened or
excused, so to say, by the pause, except where the accented or masculine
ending of the hemistich is required by the very nature of the metre,
viz. in the first acatalectic half of the Septenary line. It does,
however, not unfrequently occur in some Early Middle English poems
written in Septenary metre, e.g. in the <cite>Moral Ode</cite> and several others,
but this may be only owing to want of skill or carelessness on the part
of the authors of these poems. The following example taken from the
<cite>Moral Ode</cite> may serve to illustrate this:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Nis nán wítnesse éal se múchel, | se mánnes ágen héorte. <span class="attrib">114.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In the <cite>Ormulum</cite> irregularities of this kind never occur, a certain
proof that Orm thought them metrically inadmissible, and felt that an
extra syllable at the end of the first hemistich would disturb the flow
of the rhythm.</p>

<p>Epic caesura certainly is more in place, or at any rate more common, in
other kinds of verse, especially in the Middle English Alexandrine
formed after the Old French model, e.g.:</p>

<div class="iline">Untó the Ínglis kínges, | þat hád it ín þer hónd.</div>

§ <b>91.</b> Double or feminine endings are more frequent than epic caesuras,
especially in Middle English poetry. They become rarer, however, in the
course of time in Modern English in consequence of the gradual
disappearance of the inflexional endings, e.g.:</p>

<p>The two last quotations are noteworthy because the number of extra
syllables after the last accented one is two, three, or even four, a
peculiarity which is one of the characteristics of Fletcher’s
versification. Other poets, e.g. Shakespeare, preferred feminine
endings in some periods of their literary career, so that it is possible
to use the proportion of masculine and feminine endings occurring in a
play, compared with others of the same poet, as a means of ascertaining
the date of its origin.</p>

<p>It is also to be observed that in certain epochs or kinds of poetry
feminine endings are more in favour than in others. In the eighteenth
century they are very scarce, whereas they become more frequent again in
the nineteenth century. Byron and Moore especially use them copiously in
their satirical and humorous poems to produce burlesque effects.</p>

<p><a name="section92" id="section92"></a>
§ <b>92.</b> Another metrical licence also connected with the end of the line
is what is known as the <b>enjambement</b> or <em>run-on line</em>&mdash;that is to say,
the carrying over of the end of a sentence into the following line.</p>

<p>The rule that the end of a line must coincide with the end of a
sentence, is, from the nature of the case, more difficult to observe
strictly&mdash;and, consequently, the run-on line is more readily
admitted&mdash;in verse composed of short lines (which often do not afford
room for a complete sentence) than where the lines are longer. In blank
verse, also, the run-on line is more freely allowed than in rhymed
verse, where the pause at the end of the line is more strongly marked.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, enjambement is not allowed to separate two short
words that stand in close syntactical connexion and isolated from the
rest of the sentence, though examples of this do occur (especially in
the older poets) in which an adjective is separated from its
substantive:</p>

<p>But if, on the other hand, two closely connected parts of a sentence are
each of them long enough to fill up two measures, they may be separated
by enjambement:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The admissibility or inadmissibility, however, of run-on lines depends
on many different and complicated considerations, for which the reader
may be referred to ten Brink, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Chaucer’s Sprache und Verskunst</cite>, §§
317&ndash;20, and to our own larger work, vol. ii, pp. 59&ndash;62.</p>

<p>In Shakespeare’s versification, and probably also in that of other
poets, the more or less frequent use of run-on lines is characteristic
of certain periods of their literary career, and is therefore looked
upon as a valuable help in determining the date of the different plays
(cf. § <a href="#section91">91</a>). The largest percentage of run-on lines probably occurs in
Milton’s epics.</p>

<p><a name="section93" id="section93"></a>
§ <b>93.</b> The judicious use of run-on lines is often resorted to for
the purpose of avoiding monotony. Another metrical licence connected
with the line-end, which is adopted for the same purpose, is
<b>rhyme-breaking</b>. This occurs chiefly in rhyming couplets, and consists
in ending the sentence with the first line of the couplet, instead of
continuing it (as is usually done) till the end of the second line. Thus
the close connexion of the two lines of the couplet effected by the
rhyme is broken up by the logical or syntactic pause occurring at the
end of the first<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_149" id="Pg_149" title="149"></a> line. This is used rarely, and so to say unconsciously,
by the earlier Middle English poets, but is frequently applied, and
undoubtedly with artistic intention, by Chaucer and his successors.
The following passage contains examples both of rhyme-breaking and of
the more normal usage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line ital">A Yéman hádde he, ánd servántz namó</div>
    <div class="line ital">At thát tyme, fór him líste ríde sóo;</div>
    <div class="line ital">And hé was clád in cóte and hóod of gréne:</div>
    <div class="line ital">A shéf of pécok árwes bríght and shéne</div>
    <div class="line ital">Únder his bélt he bár ful thríftilý.</div>
    <div class="line ital">Wél koude he drésse his tákel yémanlý; <span class="normal">&amp;c.</span></div>
         <div class="attribution">Chauc. Prol. ll. 101&ndash;6.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Rhyme-breaking may, of course, also take place in other metres, as e.g.
in four-foot iambic verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
     <div class="line">Which hópe I kéep full súre in mé,</div>
     <div class="line">As hé, that áll my cómfort ís.</div>
     <div class="line">On yóu alone, which áre my blíss, <span class="normal">&amp;c.</span></div>
        <div class="attribution">Surrey, pp. 79&ndash;80.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Chapman, in his translation of Homer, often uses it in Septenary
verses as well as in five-foot iambic verses. In certain stanzas
rhyme-breaking at particular places is a strict rule, as e.g. in the
Rhyme-Royal stanza (<em>a b a b . b c c</em>), in the ballade-stanza of eight
lines (<em>a b a b . b c b c</em>), and also between the two quatrains of the
regular Italian sonnet.</p>

<p>On the other hand this licence is rare in the works of the poets of the
eighteenth century who wrote under French influence, and in modern times
(especially at the present day) it seems to be rather avoided than
intentionally admitted.</p>

<p><a name="section94" id="section94"></a>
§ <b>94.</b> Another peculiarity of frequent but irregular occurrence in
even-beat verse is <b>alliteration</b>, a feature which is derived from the
old native metre, and is still (consciously or unconsciously) employed
by many poets as an ornament of their verse.</p>

<p>The arbitrary use of alliteration in the freer form of the long line has
been already discussed.</p>

<p>In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries it is mostly used merely to
give a stronger emphasis to those words of the verse which bear the
logical and rhythmical accent,<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> but even as early as this we can
observe a decided predilection for accumulated alliteration. Sometimes
the same alliterative sound is retained through several successive
lines. In other instances a fourth<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_150" id="Pg_150" title="150"></a> alliterating word is admitted in the
line (as in the example referred to above). In the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries this striving after accumulation of alliteration was
carried to such a length that it became a rule that as many words in the
line as possible, whether accented or not, should begin with the same
letter. This accounts for King James VI’s metrical rule quoted above (p.
89), that in ‘Tumbling verse’ the line is to be ‘literal’. Even Chaucer,
in spite of his well-known hostile attitude to regular alliterative
poetry,<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> allowed his diction to be influenced strongly by it, e.g.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">I <b>w</b>réche, <b>w</b>hích that <b>w</b>épe and <b>w</b>áylle thús,</div>

      <div class="attribution">ib. line 1758.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This accumulation of alliterative sounds occurs in the works of many
Modern English poets, some of whom, as Peele and Shakespeare, have
themselves ridiculed it, but were unable, or were not careful, to avoid
it altogether in their own practice.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="subtitle">THE METRICAL TREATMENT OF SYLLABLES</span></h3>

<p><a name="section95" id="section95"></a>
§ <b>95.</b> As the root-syllables of words (leaving out of account the words
of Romanic origin) almost universally retain their full syllabic value,
whether occurring in arsis or in thesis, they require no notice in this
chapter. We therefore confine our remarks to the formative and
inflexional syllables, which, though as a rule found only in thesis,
admit of being treated metrically in three different ways. (1) A
syllable of this kind may retain its full value, so as to form by itself
the entire thesis of a foot. (2) It may be slurred, so that it combines
with another unaccented syllable to form a thesis. (3) It may lose its
syllabic value altogether, its vowel being elided and its consonantal
part (if it has any) being attracted to the root-syllable. By the
last-mentioned process, as is well known, the number of inflexional
syllables has been greatly reduced in Modern as compared with Middle and
Old English.</p>

<p>The inflexional endings which in Middle English (we are here considering
chiefly the language of Chaucer) have ordinarily the value of
independent syllables are the <span class="locked">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><em>-es</em> (<em>-is</em>, <em>-us</em>) in the gen. sing. and the plur. of the substantive,
and in certain adverbs.</p>

<p><em>-en</em> in the nom. plur. of some substantives of the weak declension, in
certain prepositions, in the infinitive, in the strong past participle,
in the plur. of the pres. of strong verbs, and in the pret. plur. of all
verbs.</p>

<p><em>-er</em> in the comparative.</p>

<p><em>-est</em> in the superlative and the 2nd person pres.</p>

<p><em>-eth</em> (<em>-ith</em>) in the 3rd person pres. sing., in the plur. pres. and
plur. imperative.</p>

<p><em>-ed</em> (<em>-id</em>, <em>-ud</em>) in the past participles of weak verbs, and often in
the 1st and 3rd person sing. and the whole plur. pret. of the weak verbs
with short root-syllable, instead of the fuller endings <em>-ede</em>, <em>-eden</em>,
which also occur; in weak verbs with long root-syllable the endings are
<em>-de</em>, <em>-den</em>.</p>

<p><em>-edest</em>, or <em>-dest</em> in the 2nd pers. sing. pret. of the weak verb.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_152" id="Pg_152" title="152"></a></p>

<p><em>-e</em> in a certain number of inflexional forms of the verb (as e.g. in
the inf. and in the past part. of strong verbs, where <em>n</em> is dropped),
and of the substantive and adjective, and as an ending of Romanic words,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Of all these endings only the comparative and superlative suffixes
<em>-er</em>, <em>-est</em> are preserved in an unreduced state in Modern English. The
final <em>-e</em> has disappeared in pronunciation (with some exceptions
occurring in Early Modern English). The important suffixes <em>-en</em>, <em>-es</em>,
<em>-ed</em>, <em>-est</em> (2nd pers. sing.), <em>-eth</em> (for which <em>-s</em>, the northern
ending, instead of <em>-es</em>, is commonly substituted) have been contracted
through syncope so as to form one syllable with the root, except where
the nature of the final consonant of the stem prevents syncope, e.g. in
<em>-es</em> and <em>-est</em> after sibilants, in <em>-ed</em> after dentals, in <em>-en</em> after
<em>v</em>, <em>s</em>, <em>t</em>, <em>d</em>, <em>k</em> (as in <em>houses</em>, <em>ended</em>, <em>risen</em>, <em>written</em>,
<em>hidden</em>, <em>broken</em>, <em>driven</em>). As, however, these are always full
syllables they may here be disregarded. The ending <em>-edest</em> has been
shortened into <em>-edst</em>.</p>

<p>It is to be observed that the syncopation of the vowel (<em>e</em>) of the
inflexional endings was not so nearly universal in Early Modern English
as it is at present; and further, that it is still much less prevalent
in poetry than in prose, because the poets for metrical reasons often
preserve the fuller endings when in ordinary speech they are no longer
used.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> In examining the metrical treatment of the Early English
inflexional endings, we shall therefore have occasion to consider the
usage of the present day, notwithstanding the fact that some of these
endings are obsolete in modern prose.</p>

<p>The chief difference between Early and Modern English with regard to the
treatment of the inflexions is that in Early English poetry the full
pronunciation is the rule&mdash;in accordance with the practice in ordinary
speech--and the syncopation of the vowel (<em>e</em>, rarely <em>i</em> or <em>u</em>) is the
exception; while in Modern English it is the shortened pronunciation
that is normal, the full syllabic form being used only exceptionally as
a poetic licence.</p>

<p><a name="section96" id="section96"></a>
§ <b>96.</b> The first point that requires notice is the treatment of the
unaccented <em>e</em> of words of three and four syllables in Middle English.
The following observations are founded on those of ten Brink, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Chaucer’s
Sprache und Verskunst</cite>, § 256.</p>

<p>1. If each of the two last syllables of a trisyllabic word has<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_153" id="Pg_153" title="153"></a>
an unaccented <em>e</em>, one of them is generally elided or slurred over under
the influence of the rhythmical accent. Thus the past tense singular of
the weak verbs <em>clepede</em>, <em>werede</em>, <em>makede</em>, <em>lovede</em> may be scanned
either <em>clepte</em>, <em>werde</em>, <em>made</em>, <em>lovde</em>, or <em>cleped</em>, <em>wered</em>,
<em>maked</em>, <em>loved</em>. Just in the same way the plural forms <em>clepeden</em>,
<em>makeden</em>, &amp;c., may be read either <em>clepten</em>, <em>maden</em>, &amp;c., or <em>cleped</em>,
<em>maked</em>, &amp;c.; likewise the plural endings of nouns <em>faderes</em>, <em>hevenes</em>
may be pronounced <em>fadres</em>, <em>hevnes</em> or <em>faders</em>, <em>hevens</em>. In Early
Middle English, however, and also in the language of Chaucer, exceptions
to this rule are found, trisyllabic scansion occurring chiefly in the
plur. pret., e.g.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Þatt úre Lóverrd Iésu Chríst, swa þóledé þe déofell.</div>
    <div class="attribution">Orm. 11822.</div>

    <div class="line">I dórste swére, they wéyedén ten póunde.</div>
    <div class="attribution">Chauc. Prol. 454.</div>

    <div class="line">Yélledén, <span class="normal">id. N. Pr. Tale, 569</span>; <em>wónedén</em>
    <span class="normal">id. Leg. 712, &amp;c.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The <em>e</em> following upon an unaccented syllable which is capable of
receiving the accent, whether in a word of Teutonic or Romanic origin,
is commonly mute. E.g. <em>banere</em>, <em>manere</em>, <em>lovere</em>, <em>ladyes</em>,
<em>housbondes</em>, <em>thousandes</em> are generally to be pronounced in verse (as,
indeed, they were probably pronounced in prose) as, <em>baner</em>, <em>maner</em>,
<em>lover</em>, <em>ladys</em>, <em>housbonds</em>, <em>thousands</em>. But this <em>e</em>, on the other
hand, not unfrequently remains syllabic, especially in the <cite>Ormulum</cite>,
where it is dropped only before a vowel or <em>h</em>. E.g. <em>cneolénn
meoklík(e) annd lútenn</em> 11392, <em>meocnéss(e) is þrínne kíness</em> 10699, <em>Forr
án godnéss(e) uss háveþþ dón</em> 185. Before a consonant or at the end of a
line, however, it is always sounded: <em>Ennglísshe ménn to láre</em> 279, <em>God
wórd and gód tiþénnde</em> 158, <em>forrþí birrþ áll Cristéne fóllc</em> 303.
<em>Goddspélless hállȝhe láre</em> 14, 42, 54, <em>þa Góddspelléss neh álle</em>
30. Other examples are: <em>And þó þet wéren gítserés</em> Moral Ode, MS. D. l.
269; <em>For thóusandés his hóndes máden dýe</em> Chauc. Troil. v, 1816;
<em>enlúminéd</em> id. A B C 73.</p>

<p>In words of four syllables a final <em>e</em> which follows upon an unaccented
syllable with a secondary accent may at pleasure either become mute or
be fully pronounced. So words like <em>óutrydère</em>, <em>sóudanèsse</em>,
<em>émperòures</em>, <em>árgumèntes</em> may be read either as three or four
syllables. Examples of <em>e</em> sounded: <em>Bifórr þe Rómanísshe kíng</em> Orm.

§ <b>97. Special remarks on individual inflexional endings.</b></p>

<p><em>-es</em> (gen. sing., nom. plur., and adverbial) is in disyllables (a) as a
rule treated as a full syllable, e.g. <em>Ac þét we dóþ for gódes lúue</em>
Moral Ode 56; <em>from éuery shíres énde</em> Chauc. Prol. 15; <em>And élles
cértain wére thei to blame</em> ib. 375; (b) seldom syncopated or slurred
over, e.g. <em>Ure álre hláuerd fór his þrélles</em> Moral Ode, 189; <em>He mákede
físses in þére sé</em> ib. 83; <em>I sáugh his sléves purfíled</em> Chauc. Prol.
193; <em>The ármes of dáun Arcíte</em> id. Kn. Tale, 2033; <em>Or élles it wás</em>
id. Sq. Tale, 209.</p>

<p>In trisyllables the reverse is the case; only Orm, who always, as is
well known, carefully counts his syllables, treats the ending as a full
syllable. Otherwise syncopation or slurring over of the last syllable is
the rule in these words: <em>a sómeres dáy</em> Chauc. Sq. Tale, 64;
<em>Gréyhoundes he hádde</em> id. Prol. 190; <em>hóusbondes át that tóun</em> id. Kn.
Tale, 78; <em>the távernes wél</em> id. Prol. 240.</p>

<p>In Modern English in all these cases elision of the <em>-e</em> is the rule,
those, of course, excepted in which the <em>-e</em> is still sounded at the
present day (after sibilants, dentals, &amp;c.) and which therefore we need
not discuss here. The use of <em>-es</em> as a full syllable is otherwise quite
exceptional, chiefly occurring in the Early Modern English poets, who
use the sounded <em>e</em>, occasionally, to gain an unaccented syllable, e.g.:</p>

<p>The usual sound of these words is <em>night’s</em>, <em>love’s</em>, <em>world’s</em>,
<em>limbs</em>, <em>eyes</em>, and so in all similar cases.</p>

<p>The syncopation of the <em>-e</em> in the adverbial <em>-es</em> is indicated, as<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_155" id="Pg_155" title="155"></a> is
well known, by the spelling, in certain cases: e.g. in <em>else</em>, <em>hence</em>,
<em>thence</em>, whence (instead of the Middle English forms <em>elles</em>, <em>hennes</em>,
&amp;c.); but even in words where it is preserved in writing, as e.g. in
<em>whiles</em>, <em>unawares</em>, it has become mute and has, as a rule, no metrical
value in Modern English poetry. The archaic <em>certes</em>, however, is still
always treated as a disyllabic, e.g.</p>

§ <b>98.</b> The ending <em>-en</em> (plur. nom. of nouns; prepositions; infinitive;
strong past part.; plur. pres. and pret. of verbs) is in Middle English
(a) commonly treated as a full syllable during the first period, and
later on mostly, although not always, to avoid hiatus, before vowels and
<em>h</em>, e.g. <em>His éyen stépe</em> Chauc. Prol. 201; <em>Bifórenn Críst allmáhhtig
Gódd</em> Orm. 175; <em>Befóren ánd behýnde</em> Alexius, ii. 393; <em>abóven álle

Blanch. 547; <em>Fór to délen with no swích poráille</em> Chauc. Prol. 247;
<em>bifrórenn</em> Orm. 13856; <em>forlórenn</em> ib. 1395; <em>Sche wás arísen ánd al

himm í þiss líf</em> ib. 210; <em>Ál þet wé misdíden hére</em> Moral Ode, 99; (b)
syncopated or slurred, especially in later times, after the <em>n</em> has been
dropped already in prepositions and verbal inflexions, e.g. <em>His póre
féren he delde</em> Alexius, ii. 210; <em>Hálles and bóures</em>, <em>óxen and plóugh</em>
ib. 12; <em>Bifórr þe Rómanísshe kíng</em> (instead of <em>biforenn</em>) Orm. 6902;
<em>Hastów had fléen al nýght</em> Chauc. Manc. Prol. 17; <em>She bóthe hir yónge
chíldren untó hir cálleþ</em> id. Cl. T. 1081; <em>is bórn: þat wenten hím

590; <em>And únderfóngen his kínedóm</em> Flor. and Blanch. 1264; <em>þei máde
sówen in þát cité</em> Alexius, i. 577; <em>Bíddeþ his mén cómen him nére</em> ib.
134; <em>Hórn</em>: <em>i-bórn</em> King Horn, 137&ndash;8; <em>forlóren</em>: <em>Hórn</em> ib. 479&ndash;80;
<em>Was rísen and rómede</em> Chauc. Kn. T. 207; <em>my líef is fáren on lónde</em>

wíssheden þat hé were déd</em> Alexius, ii. 335, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In Modern English this ending is much more rare, and is hardly ever used
as a full syllable of the verse. The plural ending <em>-en</em> of the
substantive occurs now and then in Wyatt’s<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_156" id="Pg_156" title="156"></a> and Surrey’s verse, as e.g.
in <em>éyen</em> instead of <em>éyes</em>, both in rhyme, e.g. <em>éyen</em>: <em>míne</em> Sur. 14,
and in the interior of the line, ib. 126, 128; Wyatt 8, 17, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Prepositions ending in <em>-en</em> are scarcely ever used now; sometimes the
archaic <em>withóuten</em> is to be met with in some Early Modern English
poets, and then, of course, as a trisyllable: <em>withóuten dréad</em> Sur. 95;
<em>withóuten énd</em> Spenser, F. Q. <span class="fakesc">II.</span> ix. 58. The obsolete infinitives in
<em>-en</em> may also be found sometimes in the writings of the same and other
early Modern English poets: <em>in váyn</em>: <ins class="correction" title="original: sdyen"><em>sáyen</em></ins><a name="CORR_6" id="CORR_6"></a> Sur. 31; <em>his flócke to
víewën wíde</em> Spenser, F. Q. <span class="fakesc">I.</span> i. 23; <em>to kíllën bád</em> Shak. Pericles,
II. Prol. 20. Likewise certain antiquated plural forms of the verb in
<em>-en</em>: <em>dischárgën cléan</em> Sur. 30; <em>fen</em>: <em>lífedën</em> Spenser, F. Q. II.
x. 7; <em>and wáxën ín their mírth</em> Shak. M. N. Dr. <span class="fakesc">II.</span> i. 56.</p>

<p>It is only the <em>-en</em> of the past participle that is at all often after
certain consonants treated as a full syllable, e.g. <em>the frózen héart</em>
Sur. 1; <em>gótten out</em> ib. 10; <em>the strícken déer</em> ib. 54; <em>hast táken
páin</em> Wyatt, 99. Here the full forms are preserved in the ordinary
language. It is only exceptionally that participles that have undergone
shortening, as <em>come</em>, reassume their <em>n</em> and regain an extra syllable,
e.g. <em>tíll he cómën háth</em> West (Poets, ix. 484). Contracted forms like
<em>grown</em>, <em>known</em>, <em>drawn</em>, always remain monosyllabic, even in verse,
and words like <em>fallen</em>, <em>swollen</em>, which are normally disyllabic, are
often contracted in poetry: as <em>grown</em> Sur. 13; <em>known</em> ib. 45; <em>swoln</em>
ib. 8; <em>befallen</em> ib. 26; <em>drawn</em> Wyatt, 160. Complete contraction is
effected either by elision of the final consonant of the stem, e.g.
<em>ta’en</em> (instead of <em>taken</em>) Sur. 44, or by slurring of the ending, e.g.
<em>hath gíven a pláce</em> Sur. 108; <em>is béaten with wínd and stórm</em> ib. 157,
&amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="section99" id="section99"></a>
§ <b>99.</b> The comparative and superlative endings <em>-er</em>, <em>-est</em> are, as a
rule, syllabic. <em>Hórn is fáirer þáne beo hé</em> King Horn, 330; <em>No lénger
dwélle hý ne mýghte</em> Alexius, ii. 85; <em>But ráther wólde he yéven</em> Chauc.
Prol. 487.</p>

<p>These endings are treated, moreover, as full syllables in the unaccented
rhymes <em>Hǽngest</em>: <em>fǽirest</em> Layamon, 13889&ndash;90; <em>Hǽngest</em>:
<em>héndest</em> ib. 13934&ndash;5. If an inflexional <em>-e</em> is added to such words, so
as to make them trisyllables, it is commonly elided or apocopated, e.g.
<em>Fór he ís the fáireste mán</em> Horn, 787; <em>hire grétteste óoth</em> Chauc.
Prol. 120; <em>The férreste in his párisshe</em> ib. 494. Slurring or
syncopation takes place in the following examples, <em>Sche móst wiþ hím no
lénger abíde</em> Sir Orfeo, line 328; <em>No lénger to héle óf he bráke</em>
Alexius, ii. 127; more rarely in the superlative, <em>Annd állre láttst he
wúndedd wáss</em> <a class="pagenum" name="Pg_157" id="Pg_157" title="157"></a> Orm. 11779, 11797; <em>Was thóu not fárist of ángels álle?</em>
Towneley Myst. p. 4.</p>

<p>In Modern English these endings are treated similarly. The
comparative-ending <em>-er</em> is mostly syllabic on account of the phonetic
nature of the final <em>r</em>, and even if slurred, it does not entirely lose
its syllabic character, e.g.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">The nígher my cómfort ís to mé. <span class="attrib">Surrey, p. 37.</span></div>

    <div class="line">Or dó him míghtier sérvice ás his thrálls.</div>
     <div class="attribution">Milton, Par. L. i. 149.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The ending of the superlative <em>-est</em>, too, is commonly syllabic, e.g.</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">In lóngest níght, or ín the shórtest dáy. <span class="attrib">Surrey, p. 16.</span></div>

    <div class="line">Now léss than smállest dwárfs, in nárrow róom.</div>
        <div class="attribution">Milton, P. L. i. 779.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Nevertheless many examples of syncopation are found, chiefly in the
writings of the Early Modern English poets: e.g. <em>the méekest of mínd</em>
Sur. 77; <em>the swéet’st compánions</em> Shak. Cymb. <span class="fakesc">V.</span> v. 349; <em>the stérn’st
good níght</em> id. Macb. <span class="fakesc">II.</span> ii. 4. Such forms are often used by Ben
Jonson.</p>

<p><a name="section100" id="section100"></a>
§ <b>100.</b> The ending <em>-est</em> (2nd pers. pres. sing. ind. and pret. sing.
of weak verbs) is in Middle English generally syllabic: <em>Annd
séȝȝest swíllc annd swíllc was þú</em> Orm. 1512; <em>Annd ȝíff þu
féȝesst þréo wiþ þréo, þa fíndesst tú þær séxe</em> id. 11523&ndash;4; <em>That
bróughtest Tróye</em> Chauc. N. Pr. T. 408; <em>Thow wálkest nów</em> id. Kn. T.;
<em>þat gód þat þóu þénkest do mé</em> Alexius, ii. 304; <em>Hou mýȝtest þóu
þus lónge wóne</em> Alexius, i. 445; <em>And wóldest névere ben aknówe</em> ib.
461.</p>

<p>Frequently, however, syncopation or slurring also occurs: <em>ȝiff þú
seȝȝst tátt tu lúfesst Gódd</em> Orm. 5188; <em>Þu wénest þat éch song
béo grislích</em> Owl and Night. 315; <em>Þu schríchest and ȝóllest to þíne
fére</em> ib. 223; <em>Thou knówest him well</em> Chauc. Blaunche, 137; <em>Trówest
thou? by our Lórd, I wíll thee sáy</em> ib. 551; <em>þou mýȝtest have bén a
grét lordíng</em> Alexius, i. 511.</p>

<p>In Modern English syncopation is extremely common, e.g. <em>Now knówest
thou áll</em> Sur. 27; <em>That mákest but gáme</em> Wyatt, 30, &amp;c.; but the full
syllabic pronunciation (in accordance with the modern prose usage) is
also frequent, both in the poetry of the sixteenth century, e.g. <em>What
frámëst thóu</em> Sur. 158; <em>And lóokëst tó commánd</em> Shak. H. VI. <span class="fakesc">I.</span> i. 38;
and in that of recent times, e.g.:</p>

§ <b>101.</b> The ending <em>-eth</em>, in the North <em>-es</em>, <em>-is</em> (3rd pers. sing.
pres., plur. pres., and 3rd pers. sing. imperative), is in most cases
syllabic in Middle English, especially before the fifteenth century;
e.g. <em>It túrrneþþ hémm till sínne</em> Orm. 150; <em>þat spékeþþ óff þe
déofell</em> ib. 11944; <em>þat ǽfre annd ǽfre stándeþþ ínn</em> ib. 2617;
<em>þánne hi cumeþ éft</em> Moral Ode, 236; <em>Hi wálkeþ éure</em> ib. 239; <em>So
príkeþ hem natúre</em> Chauc. Prol. 11; <em>Cómeþ álle nów to mé</em> Alexius, ii.
337; <em>Ánd a-fóngeþ ȝóure méde</em> ib. 375.</p>

<p>But already in the earlier portion of this epoch of the language
slurring or syncopation is often to be met with, and it became gradually
more and more frequent. <em>Boc séȝȝþ þe bírrþ wel ȝémenn þé</em> Orm.
11373, 11981; <em>Annd áȝȝ afftérr þe góddspell stánnt</em> ib. 33; <em>And
thínkeþ, here cómeþ my mórtel énemý</em> Chauc. Kn. T. 785; <em>Comeþ nér,
quoth hé</em> id. Prol. 839; <em>þat háveþ traváille</em> Alexius, i. 350; <em>Thai
háldis this lánd agáyne resóune</em> Barbour’s Bruce, i. 488.</p>

<p>In Modern English the endings <em>-eth</em> and <em>-es</em> (<em>’s</em>) were at first used
promiscuously; later <em>-eth</em> is employed, if a full syllable is required,
<em>-es</em> (<em>’s</em>) if syncopation is intended; but this rule is not strictly
observed.</p>

<p>The dropping of <em>e</em> on the whole is the more usual: e.g. <em>begins</em> Sur.
1; <em>seems</em> ib. 2; <em>learns</em> Wyatt, 1; also if written <em>-eth</em>: <em>On hím
that lóveth not mé</em> Wyatt, 57; <em>that séeth the héavens</em> Sur. 2.
Treatment as a full syllable is less usual: <em>But áll too láte Love
léarnëth mé</em> Sur. 5; <em>Lóve that lívëth and réignëth ín my thóught</em> Sur.
12. Shakespeare and his contemporaries still use it somewhat frequently
(cf. Hertzberg in <em>Shakspeare-Jahrb.</em> xiii, pp. 255&ndash;7), and occasional
instances are found even in later poets, as for instance in Keats, who
rhymes: <em>death: ouershádowéth</em>, p. 336; Chr. Rossetti, <em>déath:
fashionéth</em> p. 28, ii. ll. 5&ndash;6</p>

<p><a name="section102" id="section102"></a>
§ <b>102.</b> The ending <em>-ed</em>, in the North <em>-id</em>, <em>-it</em> (past part. of weak
verbs), is, as a rule, syllabic in Middle English: e.g. <em>Min Dríhhtin
háfeþþ lénedd</em> Orm. 16; <em>Annd ícc itt háfe fórþedd té</em> ib. 25; <em>Annd
tǽrfore háfe icc túrrnedd ítt</em> ib. 129; <em>ipróved ófte síthes</em> Chauc.
Prol. 485; <em>hadde swówned wíth a dédly chére</em> ib. Kn. T. 55; <em>Nóu is
Álex dwélled þóre</em> Alexius, i. 121; <em>Lóverd, iþánked bé þou áy</em> ib. 157;
<em>A wéile gret quhíle thar duellyt hé</em> Barbour, Bruce, i. 359.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_159" id="Pg_159" title="159"></a></p>

<p>But slurring and syncopation likewise are of frequent occurrence: <em>þatt
háffdenn cwémmd himm í þiss líf</em> ib. 211; <em>þet scúlle béo to déþe idémd</em>
Moral Ode, 106; <em>His lónge héer was kémbd behýnde his bák</em> Chauc. Kn. T.
1285; <em>Fulfíld of íre</em> ib. 82; especially in words with the accent on
the antepenultima, e.g. <em>Ybúried nór ibrént</em> ib. 88; <em>and hán hem
cáried sófte</em> ib. 153; <em>And ben yhónowrid ás a kýng</em> Alexius, i. 5, 12
(MS. N).</p>

<p>In this ending, too, syncopation (<em>-ed</em>, <em>’d</em>, <em>t</em>) is the rule already
in the earliest Modern English poets: <em>offer’d</em> Sur. 6; <em>transgrést</em> ib.
11; <em>that prómised wás to thée</em> ib. 35. The use of it as a full
syllable, however, is very frequently to be met with, chiefly in
participles used as adjectives: <em>the párchëd gréen restórëd ís with
sháde</em> Sur. 1; <em>by wéll assúrëd móan</em> Wyatt, 4; <em>but ármëd síghs</em> ib. 4;
<em>false féignëd gráce</em> ib. 4. The dramatists of the Elizabethan time (cf.
<cite>Engl. Metrik</cite>, ii. 336) similarly often use the full ending; and even
in modern poets it is not uncommon: <em>where wé’ve involvëd óthers</em> Burns,
Remorse, l. 11 ; <em>The chármëd Goad begán</em> Keats, Lamia, p. 185, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="section103" id="section103"></a>
§ <b>103.</b> The ending <em>-ed</em> (<em>-od</em>, <em>-ud</em>) of the 1st and 3rd pers. sing.
pret. and the whole plur. pret. of weak verbs, which is shortened from
<em>-ede</em>, <em>-ode</em>, <em>-ude</em>, <em>-eden</em>, <em>-oden</em>, <em>-uden</em> (cf. § <a href="#section96">96</a>), is in
Middle English usually syllabic: e.g. <em>Mést al þét me líked(e) þó</em>
Moral Ode, 7 ; <em>Oure lóverd þát al máked(e) iwís</em> Pop. Science, 2; <em>He
énded(e) and cléped(e) yt Léicestre</em> Rob. of Glouc., p. 29; <em>The fáder
hem lóued(e) álle ynóȝ</em> ib.; <em>Híre overlíppe wýpud(e) sché so cléne</em>
Chauc. Prol. 107; <em>An óutridére þat lóved(e) vénerýe</em> ib. 165; <em>Ne máked
hím a spíced cónsciénce</em> ib. 526; <em>þei préced évere nére and nére</em>
Alexius, i. 583 (MS. V).</p>

<p>As several of these examples show, slurring occasionally takes place, so
that the ending forms part of a disyllabic thesis, but real syncopation
never occurs; cf. further: <em>Ánd asségit it rýgorouslý</em> Barbour, Bruce,
i. 88; <em>and évere I hóped(e) of be to hére</em> Alexius, ii. 482.</p>

<p>With regard to these endings from the beginning of the Modern English
epoch onward syncopation (<em>[e]d</em>, <em>’d</em>, <em>t</em>) is the rule; <em>defied</em> Sur.
10; <em>sustain’d</em> ib. 15; <em>opprest</em> Wyatt, 107. But the full syllable not
infrequently occurs: <em>I lóokëd báck</em> Sur. 4; <em>I néver próvëd nóne</em>
Wyatt, 39. It is characteristic of Spenser’s archaistic style, and is
often met with in the Elizabethan dramatists; Shakespeare, however, uses
it much more frequently in his earlier than in his later plays. The more
recent poets admit it in single cases: <em>said</em>: <em>vánishéd</em> Keats, Lamia,
p. 202.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_160" id="Pg_160"></a></p>

<p><a name="section104" id="section104"></a>
§ <b>104.</b> The final <em>-e</em> is treated in Modern English poetry in the same
manner as in Modern High German: it may be either used as a thesis, or
be slurred over, or become quite silent. In Middle English, however, the
treatment of the final <em>-e</em> depends much more on the following word than
on the etymological origin of the <em>-e</em>. It becomes mute, of course,
mostly before <em>h</em> or a vowel, but is generally preserved (as a thesis)
or slurred before a consonant. This rule has, however, many exceptions.</p>

<p>Orm and other poets of the beginning of the thirteenth century give the
final <em>e</em> its full syllabic value in certain classes of words in which
Chaucer<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> in the second half of the fourteenth century generally
slurs it.</p>

<p>These words are the pronouns <em>hire</em>, <em>oure</em>, <em>ȝoure</em>, <em>here</em>, <em>myne</em>,
<em>thyne</em> (also spelled without <em>e</em>), if they do not stand in rhyme; the
plural forms <em>thise</em>, <em>some</em>, <em>swiche</em>, <em>whiche</em>; the past part. of
strong verbs with an originally short root, the inflexional <em>n</em> being
apocopated, e.g. <em>come</em>, <em>write</em>, <em>stole</em>; the 2nd pers. sing. of the
strong pret., e.g. <em>bare</em>, <em>tooke</em>, except such words as <em>songe</em>,
<em>founde</em>, and others of the same group; the preterites <em>were</em> and
<em>made</em>; the nouns <em>sone</em>, <em>wone</em>; the French words in <em>-ye</em>, <em>-aye</em>,
<em>-eye</em>, and, finally, the words <em>before</em>, <em>tofore</em>, <em>there</em>, <em>heere</em>.</p>

<p>In most of these cases it is easy enough to give examples of the
syllabic use of the <em>-e</em>, both from the earliest and from later poets:
<em>Off úre sáwless néde</em> Orm. 11402; <em>þatt úre Láferrd Iésu Críst</em> ib.
11403, 11803, &amp;c.; <em>ȝérne hy þónkede óure dríghte</em> Alexius, ii. 35;
<em>Annd ȝúre sáwless fóde íss éc</em> Orm. 11691, &amp;c.; <em>þatt ȝúre
préostess hállȝhenn</em> ib. 11694; <em>Till híse déore þéowwess</em> ib. 11556;
<em>Att álle þíne néde</em> ib. 11366, 11914, &amp;c.; Owl and Nightingale, 220,
221, &amp;c.; <em>Cástel gód an míne ríse</em> ib. 175, 282; <em>Forgíve hémm hére
sínne</em> Orm. 86; <em>Annd wílle iss híre þrídde máhht</em> ib. 11509; <em>For híre

télle</em> ib. 293; <em>þése wíkkede fóde</em> ib. 333; <em>And máde mé wíþ him ríde</em>
Sir Orfeo, 153. &amp;c.</p>

<p>All these words may, however, also be found with slurring or syncopation
of the <em>e</em>, even in Early Middle English: <em>Annd þéowwtenn wél wiþþ áll
þin máhht</em> Orm. 11393; <em>þa wǽre he þǽr bikǽchedd</em> ib. 11628;
<em>Annd súme itt áll forrwérrþenn</em> ib. 11512; <em>Min héorte atflíhþ and fált

later Middle English this is more common: <em>An ýmage óf hire sóne</em>
Alexius i. 105; <em>þeróf to gód þei máde here móne</em> ib. 32; <em>Sómme þat óf

§ <b>106.</b> In poems written in more southern dialects the final <em>-e</em>
retains its syllabic value later than in those of the North, in
agreement with the actual usage of the dialects of these districts. <cite>Sir
Tristrem</cite> (c. 1300) has still many syllabic <em>e</em>’s in thesis; in the
<cite>Cursor Mundi</cite> (c. 1320) and the <cite>Metrical Homilies</cite> (c. 1330) they are
not so numerous, and they are still rarer in the poems of Laurence Minot
(c. 1352) and of Thomas of Erceldoune. The editor of the last-mentioned
poet, Prof. Alois Brandl, rejects the syllabic final <em>-e</em> altogether in
opposition to ten Brink and Luick. In Barbour’s <cite>Bruce</cite> (c. 1375) it is
entirely <span class="locked">silent.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></span></p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_163" id="Pg_163" title="163"></a></p>

<p>But in the later poetry of the North, which was largely under the
influence of southern English models, chiefly of Chaucer, many
inflexional endings, especially various kinds of final <em>-e</em>, have a
metrical value. King James I, one of the most eminent Scottish poets,
e.g., is a strict follower of Chaucer in this respect, both in
versification and language.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> This will be shown by the following
examples: <em>Myn éyen gán to smért</em> stanza 8; <em>To séken hélp</em> 99; <em>that
néver chánge wóld</em> 83; <em>That féynen óutward</em> 136; <em>That ménen wéle</em> 137;
<em>We wéren áll</em> 24; <em>Lýke to an hérte schápin vérilý</em> 48; <em>Thús sall on
thé my chárge béne iláid</em> 120; <em>in lúfe fór a whíle</em> 134; <em>Now, swéte
bírd, say ónes tó me pépe, I dée for wó; me thínk thou gýnnis slépe</em> 57;
<em>And ón the smále gréne twístis sát</em> 33; <em>Withín a chámber, lárge, równ,
and fáire</em> 77.</p>

<p>Other Scottish poets, like Dunbar, use the final <em>e</em> in the same way,
but much more sparingly: <em>Amáng the gréne ríspis ánd the rédis</em> Terge
56; <em>And gréne lévis dóing of déw doun fléit</em> Thrissil and Rois 49;
<em>scho sénd the swífte Ró</em> ib. 78; <em>when Mérche wés with váriand wíndis
past</em> ib. 1.</p>

<p>Only the inflexional endings of substantives and of verbs are used by
Dunbar somewhat more frequently as full syllables, e.g.: <em>Had máid the
bírdis to begín thair hóuris</em> Thrissil and Rois 5; <em>of flóuris fórgit
néw</em> ib. 18; <em>the blástis óf his hórne</em> ib. 34; <em>In át the wíndow lúkit
bý the dáy</em> ib. 10; <em>And hálsit mé</em> ib. 11; <em>Bálmit in déw</em> ib. 20; <em>The
pérlit dróppis schúke</em> Terge 14. Even Lyndesay still uses certain full
endings now and then in this way: <em>Éleméntis: intént is</em> Monarchie
247&ndash;8; <em>thay cán nocht ús it: abúsit</em> Satire 2897&ndash;8; <em>Quhow Í ressávit
cónfort</em> Monarchie 132; <em>Lyke áurient péirles ón the twístis háng</em> ib.
136. But the final <em>-e</em> is hardly ever found in his verses forming a
thesis.</p>

<p>On the other hand some contemporary authors of the South, reckoned as
included in the Modern English period, continue to admit in several
cases the syllabic final <em>-e</em>, but this can only be regarded as an
exception. E. g. <em>The sótë séason, that búd and blóom forth bríngs</em>
Surrey, p. 3; <em>Thát the Gréeks bróught to Tróyë tówn</em> ib. 21; <em>Hersélf
in shádow óf the clósë níght</em> ib. 138; <em>Agáinst the búlwark óf the
fléshë fráil</em> Wyatt 207; <em>But tréated áfter á divérsë fáshion</em> ib. 7.</p>

<p>Spenser does not seem to admit syllabic final <em>-e</em>, in spite of his
archaic style.</p>

<p><a name="section107" id="section107"></a>
§ <b>107.</b> Like the inflexional syllables, the suffixes of derivatives may
be treated in a twofold manner. Those of Germanic origin<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_164" id="Pg_164" title="164"></a> for the most
part call for little remark, as many of them have coalesced with the
root of the word, and others, as e.g. the syllables <em>-ing</em>, <em>-ness</em>, <em>-y</em>,
<em>-ly</em>, can, on account of their phonetic character, only be metrically
treated as full syllables. Only a few fluctuate in their metrical
treatment, as e.g. <em>-en</em>, <em>-er</em>, <em>-le</em>, mostly after a consonant; these
will be dealt with in the section on the slurring of syllables.</p>

<p>Of much greater importance are the formative endings of Romanic origin,
especially those which begin with an <em>i</em>, <em>e</em>, or <em>u</em> + a vowel, as
<em>-iage</em>, <em>-ian</em>, <em>-iaunt</em>, <em>-iance</em>, <em>-ience</em>, <em>-ient</em>, <em>-ier</em>, <em>-ioun</em>,
<em>-ious</em>, <em>-eous</em>, <em>-uous</em>, <em>-ial</em>, <em>-ual</em>, <em>-iat</em>, <em>-iour</em>. Such endings
may either have their full value, or be slurred in rhythm, i.e. they may
be treated either as disyllabic or as monosyllabic.</p>

<p>The full forms do not occur frequently in the interior of the line, but
mostly in the last foot, where the endings bear the last arsis and offer
a convenient rhyme. Hence we conclude, that the slurred pronunciation
(synizesis) had in the later Middle English period already become
general in ordinary speech, although the full value is in rhyme-words
certainly more common: e.g. <em>viáge: pílgrimáge</em> Chaucer, Prol. 77&ndash;8;
<em>langáge: márriáge</em> ib. 211&ndash;12; <em>térciáne: báne</em> N. Pr. Tale 139&ndash;40;
<em>córdiál: spéciál</em> Prol. 443&ndash;4; <em>ethériáll: impériáll</em> Lyndesay,
Monarchie 139&ndash;40; <em>curát: licénciát</em> Chauc. Prol. 219&ndash;20; <em>láste :
ecclésiáste</em> ib. 707&ndash;8; <em>réverénce: cónsciénce</em> ib. 225&ndash;6; <em>offénce :
páciénce</em> Kn. T. 225&ndash;6; <em>dísposícióun: cónstellációun</em> ib. 229&ndash;30;
<em>prisóun: compássióun</em> ib. 251&ndash;2; <em>áscendént: páciént</em> Prol. 117&ndash;18;
<em>obédiént: assént</em> ib. 851&ndash;2; <em>óriént: résplendént</em> Lyndesay,
Monarchie 140&ndash;2; <em>glorióus: précióus</em> ib. 28&ndash;32, 44&ndash;5, 48&ndash;52, 75&ndash;9,
151&ndash;2, &amp;c.; <em>ymágynációun: impréssióun: illusióun</em> James I, Kingis
Quair, st. 12; <em>nációun: mýlióun: méncióun</em> ib. st. 78. Slurred
endings: <em>Ful wél bilóved and fámuliér was hé</em> Chauc. Prol. 215; <em>And
spéciallý</em> ib. 15; <em>a cúrious pýn</em> ib. 196; <em>Perpétuellý, not ónly fór
a yéer</em> Kn. T. 600; <em>Suspécious wás the</em> Clerk’s T. 540; <em>This sérgeant
cám</em> ib. 575, 582, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Later on slurring becomes more frequent, mainly in the North, e.g. in
Dunbar’s poems: <em>with váriand wíndis pást</em> Thrissil and Rois 1; <em>wíth
ane órient blást</em>, ib. 3; <em>So bústeous ár the blástis</em> ib. 35; <em>ane
ínhibítioun tháir</em> ib. 64 (but <em>condítióun: renówn: fassóun</em> 79&ndash;82); <em>A
rádius crówn</em> ib. 132; Lyndesay, Monarchie: <em>On sénsuall Lúste</em> 9; <em>Lyke
áurient péirles</em> 136; <em>and búrial bémes</em> 142; <em>his régioun áuroráll</em>
148; <em>Quhilk sítuate ár</em> 166; <em>melódious ármonýe</em> 195; <em>off thát
mellífluous, fámous</em> 232; <em>And síc vaine súperstítioun tó refúse</em> 242;
<em>The quhílk gaif sápience</em> 249.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_165" id="Pg_165" title="165"></a></p>

<p>In the Modern English period of the language slurring of such syllables
is the rule, in conformity with the actual pronunciation in prose,
contrary to the usage of Chaucer and other Early Middle English poets.
Only exceptionally the unshortened use obtains chiefly in earlier Modern
English, as the following examples show:</p>

<p>For other examples cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii. § 40</p>

<p><a name="section108" id="section108"></a>
§ <b>108.</b> By the side of this artificial attribution of full syllabic
value to Romanic endings which in ordinary pronunciation are contracted,
there are many examples of the opposite process, namely the contraction,
for metrical purposes, of words that are ordinarily pronounced in full.
Both these devices serve the same purpose, that of adjusting the number
of syllables to the requirements of the rhythm.</p>

<p>In the former case a syllable which commonly is pronounced quickly and
indistinctly is uttered more distinctly and more slowly than in ordinary
speech. In the latter, a couple of successive syllables or words are
uttered more indistinctly and quickly than in ordinary speech,
frequently so much so that a syllable may be entirely suppressed. Hence
the slurring of syllables results, according to the degree of
contraction, either in a disyllabic thesis, or in the complete
coalescence of two syllables. The former takes place if the final
unaccented vowel of a polysyllable is run into the following unaccented
word consisting of, or beginning with, a vowel, e.g.:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_166" id="Pg_166" title="166"></a></p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>In cases like these it cannot be supposed that there is actual elision
of a syllable, by which <em>many a</em>, <em>busy a</em>, <em>carie a</em>, <em>glorie and</em>,
<em>happy are</em>, <em>country I</em>, <em>sorry am</em>, would be reduced to regular
disyllabic feet. In several of the instances such an assumption is
forbidden not only by the indistinctness of pronunciation which it would
involve, but also by the caesura.</p>

<p>Further, we find both in Middle and in Modern English poetry many
examples of similar sequences in which there is neither elision nor
slurring, the syllable ending with a vowel forming the thesis, and the
following syllable beginning with a vowel forming the arsis. Hiatus of
this kind has always been perfectly admissible in English verse.</p>

by a monosyllabic word, standing in thesis, e.g. <em>th’estat</em>, <em>th’array</em>
Chauc. Prol. 716; <em>th’ascendent</em> ib. 117; <em>t’allege</em> (<em>to allege</em>) Kn.
T. 2142; <em>nys</em> (<em>ne ys</em>) ib. 43. Even in Modern English poetry such
contractions occur rather frequently: <em>Th’altar</em> Sur. 118; <em>t’assay</em>
Wyatt 157; <em>N’other</em> ib. 21; often also the words are written in full,
although the first vowel is metrically slurred or elided: <em>the͡ ónly
darling</em> Shakesp. All’s Well, <span class="fakesc">II.</span> i. 110. Yet in all such cases the
entire loss of the syllable must not be assumed unless the distinctness
of the pronunciation&mdash;which must be the only guide in such matters, not
the silent reading with the eyes&mdash;be sufficiently <span class="locked">preserved.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></span></p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_167" id="Pg_167" title="167"></a></p>

<p>Accordingly words like <em>the</em>, <em>to</em> are not so often contracted with the
following word, as <em>ne</em>, the amalgamation of which, with the verb to
which it belongs, is in accordance with normal Middle English usage:
<em>nas</em> = <em>ne was</em>, <em>nil</em> = <em>ne wil</em>, <em>nolde</em> = <em>ne wolde</em>, <em>noot</em> = <em>ne
woot</em>, <em>niste</em> = <em>ne wiste</em>, e.g.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="iline">There nas no dore that he nolde heve of harre.</div>
      <div class="attribution">Chauc. Prol. 550.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Neither in Middle English nor in Modern English poetry, however, is
there any compulsion to use such contractions for the purpose of
avoiding the <em>hiatus</em>, which never was prohibited. They merely serve the
momentary need of the poet. Forms like <em>min</em> and <em>thin</em>, it is true, are
regularly used by Middle English poets before vowels, and <em>my</em> and <em>thy</em>
before consonants, and Chaucer applies&mdash;according to ten Brink&mdash;<em>from</em>,
<em>oon</em>, <em>noon</em>, <em>an</em>, <em>-lych</em>, <em>-lyche</em> before vowels, and <em>fro</em>, <em>a</em>,
<em>o</em>, <em>no</em>, <em>-ly</em> before consonants. But many examples of epic caesura
show that ten Brink goes too far in maintaining that hiatus was strictly
avoided, e.g.: <em>Whan théy were wónnë; | and ín the Gréete sée</em> Prol.
59. This is still more clearly shown by verses in which the final <em>-e</em>
forms a necessary thesis before a vowel, e.g.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">

  </div>
</div>

<p><a name="section110" id="section110"></a>
§ <b>110.</b> Slurring or contraction is still more frequently the result of
indistinct pronunciation or entire elision of a vowel in the interior of
a word. This is especially the case with e (or another vowel) in the
sequence: conson. + <em>e</em> + <em>r</em> + vowel or <em>h</em>, where <em>e</em> is slurred over
or syncopated: e.g. <em>And báthed év(e)ry véin</em> Chauc. Prol. 3; <em>Thy
sóv(e)rein témple wól I móst honóuren</em> Kn. T. 1549; and <em>év(e)ry trée</em>
Sur. 9; <em>the bóist(e)rous wínds</em> Sur. 21; <em>if ám(o)rous fáith</em> Wyatt 15;
<em>a dáng(e)rous cáse</em> Sur. 4, &amp;c. The full pronunciation is, of course,
here also possible: <em>and dángeróus distréss</em> Sur. 150. Slurring of a
vowel is also caused by this combination of sounds formed by two
successive words: <em>a bétre envýned mán</em> Chauc. Prol. 342; <em>Forgétter of
páin</em> Wyatt 33. Other words of the same kind are <em>adder</em>, <em>after</em>,
<em>anger</em>, <em>beggar</em>, <em>chamber</em>, <em>silver</em>, <em>water</em>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> The same rule
applies to the group <em>e</em> + <em>l</em> + vowel or <em>h</em> (also <em>l</em> + <em>e</em> + vowel or
<em>h</em>): <em>hire wýmpel͡ ipynched was</em> Chauc. Prol. 151; <em>At <a class="pagenum" name="Pg_168" id="Pg_168" title="168"></a>mány a
nóble͡ arríve</em> ib. 60; <em>nóble͡ and hígh</em> Wyatt 55; <em>the néedle his
fínger prícks</em> Shak. Lucrece 319.</p>

<p>If a consonant takes the place of the vowel or <em>h</em> at the end of such a
group of sounds, we have a disyllabic thesis instead of slurring: <em>With
hórrible féar as óne that gréatly dréadeth</em> Wyatt 149; <em>The cómmon
péople by númbers swárm to ús</em> Shak. 3 Hen. VI, <span class="fakesc">IV.</span> ii. 2. Similar
slurrings are to be found&mdash;although more seldom and mainly in Modern
English poetry&mdash;with other groups of sounds, e.g.: <em>én’mies sword</em> Sur.
137; <em>théat’ner</em> ib. 162; <em>prís’ners</em> ib. 12. The vowel <em>i</em>, also, is
sometimes slurred; <em>Incónt(i)nent</em> Wyatt, 110; <em>dést(i)ny</em> ib. 8, &amp;c. In
all these cases we must of course recognize only slurring, not
syncopation of the vowel; and in general these words are used with their
full syllabic value in the rhythm of a verse.</p>

<p>Another kind of slurring&mdash;occurring almost exclusively in Modern English
poetry&mdash;is effected by contraction of a short vowel with a preceding
long one, so that a disyllabic word becomes monosyllabic, e.g.,
<em>flower</em>, <em>lower</em>, <em>power</em>, <em>tower</em>, <em>coward</em>, <em>prayer</em>, <em>jewel</em>,
<em>cruel</em>, <em>doing</em>, <em>going</em>, <em>being</em>, <em>seeing</em>, <em>dying</em>, <em>playing</em>,
<em>praying</em>, <em>knowing</em>, &amp;c.: <em>Whose pówer divíne</em> Sur. 118; <ins class="correction" title="original: prayer:
payr"><em>prayer: prayr</em></ins><a name="CORR_7" id="CORR_7"></a> Wyatt 26; <em>His crúel despíte</em> Sur. 7.</p>

<p>All these words are, of course, not less frequently used as disyllables
sometimes even when their usual pronunciation is monosyllabic, e.g.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">How óft have Í, my déar and crúël foe.<span class="attrib">Wyatt 14.</span></div>

    <div class="line">There ís no pówer ín the tóngue of mán. <span class="attrib">id. Merch. <span class="fakesc">IV.</span> i. 241</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a name="section111" id="section111"></a>
§ <b>111.</b> Other groups of sounds which allow slurring are: vowel + <em>r</em> +
vowel, where the second vowel may be slurred, e.g., <em>spirit</em>, <em>alarum</em>,
<em>warrant</em>, <em>nourish</em>, <em>flourish</em>, &amp;c.; <em>My fáther’s spírit in árms!</em>
Shak. Haml. <span class="fakesc">I.</span> ii. 255; <em>flóurishing péopled tówns</em> id. Gentl. <span class="fakesc">V.</span>iv. 3;
<em>I wárrant, it wíll</em> id. Haml. <span class="fakesc">I.</span> ii. 243. In the group vowel + <em>v</em> +
<em>e(i)</em>+cons. the <em>v</em> is slurred, if a consonant appears as the initial
sound of the following word, and <em>e(i)</em> if the following word begins
with a vowel. Such words are: <em>heaven</em>, <em>seven</em>, <em>eleven</em>, <em>devil</em>,
<em>even</em>, <em>ever</em>, <em>never</em>, &amp;c.; e.g., <em>and é’en the whóle</em> Wyatt 80; <em>had
néver his fíll</em> id. 108; <em>disdáin they né’er so múch</em> Shak. 1 Hen. VI,
<span class="fakesc">V.</span> iii. 98; <em>and drível on péarls</em> Wyatt 195. These words have, of
course, not less frequently their full<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_169" id="Pg_169" title="169"></a> syllabic value: <em>Of Héaven
gátes</em> Wyatt 222; <em>Then sét this drível óut of dóor</em> Sur. 79. Also <em>th</em>
between vowels may be subjected to slurring, as in <em>whether</em>, <em>whither</em>,
<em>hither</em>, <em>thither</em>, <em>either</em>, <em>neither</em>, <em>rather</em>, <em>further</em>, &amp;c.;
e.g., <em>go ásk him whíther he góes</em> Shak. 1 Hen. VI, <span class="fakesc">II.</span> iii. 28; <em>Good
Sír, say whéther you’ll ánswer mé or nót</em>, id. Caes. <span class="fakesc">V.</span> iv. 30; <em>Whether
óught to ús unknówn</em> id. Haml. <span class="fakesc">II.</span> ii. 17.</p>

<p>When a syllabic inflexional ending forms one thesis with a following
syllable, as in <em>The ímages of revólt</em> Shak. Lear, <span class="fakesc">II.</span> iv. 91; <em>I hád
not quóted him</em> id. Haml. <span class="fakesc">II.</span> i. 112, &amp;c., it is preferable to assume a
disyllabic thesis rather than a slurring. Sometimes, however, the <em>-ed</em>
of past participles (rarely of preterites) of verbs ending in <em>t</em> is
actually cut off, as <em>torment</em> instead of <em>tormented</em> Wyatt 137;
<em>deject</em> instead of <em>dejected</em> Shak. Haml. <span class="fakesc">III.</span> i. 163.</p>

<p>Contractions of another kind&mdash;partly to be explained by negligent
colloquial pronunciation&mdash;are: <em>ta’en</em> (=<em>taken</em>) Wyatt 182; <em>I’ll</em> (=<em>I
will</em>) Shak. Tempest, <span class="fakesc">II.</span> ii. 419; <em>carry ’em</em> <ins class="correction" title="(=carry them id .2">(=<em>carry them</em>) id. 2</ins><a name="CORR_8" id="CORR_8"></a> Hen.
VI, <span class="fakesc">I.</span> iv. 76, &amp;c.; <em>Ma</em>(<em>d</em>)<em>am</em> id. Gent. <span class="fakesc">II.</span> i. 6; <em>in’s</em> (=<em>in his</em>),
<em>doff</em> (=<em>do off</em>), <em>dout</em> (=<em>do out</em>), <em>o’ the</em> (=<em>of the</em>), <em>w’us</em> (=<em>with
us</em>), <em>let’s</em> (=<em>let us</em>), <em>thou’rt</em> (=<em>thou art</em>), &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Finally, we have to mention the apocopation, for metrical reasons, of
unaccented prefixes, as <em>’bove</em> (<em>above</em>), <em>’cause</em> (<em>because)</em>, <em>’longs</em>
(<em>belongs</em>), &amp;c., which on the whole cannot easily be <span class="locked">misunderstood.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="section112" id="section112"></a>
§ <b>112</b>. A contrast to these various forms of shortening is presented by
the <b>lengthening</b> of words for metrical purposes, which we have already
in part discussed in the preceding chapter (see for examples § <a href="#section87">87</a>).
Disyllabic words are made trisyllabic by inserting an <em>e</em> (or rarely
<em>i</em>) between mute and liquid, e.g., <em>wond</em>(<em>e</em>)<em>rous</em>, <em>pilg</em>(<em>e</em>)<em>rim</em>,
<em>count</em>(<em>e</em>)<em>ry</em>, <em>breth</em>(<em>e</em>)<em>ren</em>, <em>ent</em>(<em>e</em>)<em>rance</em>, <em>child</em>(<em>e</em>)<em>ren</em>, <em>Eng</em>(<em>e</em>)<em>land</em>,
<em>troub</em>(<em>e</em>)<em>lous</em>, <em>light</em>(<em>e</em>)<em>ning</em>, <em>short</em>(<em>e</em>)<em>ly</em>, <em>jugg</em>(<em>e</em>)<em>ler</em>, <span class="locked">&amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the monosyllabic words or accented endings of words which admit of
a disyllabic pronunciation for the sake of metre we have mainly to
consider such as have a diphthong in their root, as <em>our</em>, <em>sour</em>,
<em>devour</em>, <em>hour</em>, <em>desire</em>, <em>fire</em>, <em>ire</em>, <em>sire</em>, <em>hire</em>, <em>squire</em>,
<em>inquire</em>, &amp;c., or such as approach diphthongal pronunciation and
therefore admit of being treated as disyllables, e.g., <em>dear</em>, <em>fear</em>,
<em>hear</em>, <em>near</em>, <em>tear</em>, <em>clear</em>, <em>year</em>. The disyllabic use of words of
the<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_170" id="Pg_170" title="170"></a> latter class is very rare, though a striking example is afforded by
the rhyme <em>see her: clear</em> Mrs. Browning, iii, p. 57. Some other words,
phonetically analogous to these, but popularly apprehended as containing
a simple long vowel, as <em>fair</em>, <em>fare</em>, <em>are</em>, <em>here</em>, <em>there</em>, <em>rare</em>,
<em>sphere</em>, <em>were</em>, <em>more</em>, <em>door</em>, <em>your</em>, are added to the list by
Abbott, but with doubtful correctness (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii. 115&ndash;17).</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="subtitle">WORD-ACCENT</span></h3>

<p><a name="section113" id="section113"></a>
§ <b>113.</b> In discussing the English Word-accent and its relationship to
rhythmic accent it is necessary to consider the Middle English and the
Modern English periods separately, for two reasons. First, because the
inflexional endings which play an important part in Middle English are
almost entirely lost in Modern English, and secondly, because the
word-accent of the Romanic element of the language differs considerably
in the Middle English period from what it became in Modern English. In
the treatment of each period it will be convenient to separate Germanic
from Romanic words.</p>


<h4>I. Word-accent in Middle English.</h4>

<p><b>A. Germanic words.</b> The general laws of Germanic accentuation of
words, as existing in Old English, have been mentioned above (cf. §§ 18,
19). The same laws are binding also for Middle English and Modern
English.</p>

<p>The main law for all accentual versification is this, that verse-accent
must always coincide with word-accent. This holds good for all even-beat
kinds of verse, as well as for the alliterative line.</p>

<p>The language in all works of the same date and dialect, in whatever
kinds of verse they may be written, must obey the same laws of
accentuation. For this reason the results derived from the relation in
which the word-accent and the metrical value of syllables stand to the
verse-accent, with regard to the general laws of accentuation, and
especially those of inflexional syllables, must be the same for the
language of all even-beat kinds of verse as for that of the contemporary
alliterative line, or the verse of Layamon’s <cite>Brut</cite> and other works
written in a similar form of verse and derived from the ancient native
metre.</p>

<p>Now, when we wish to ascertain the state of accentuation of forms of
words no longer spoken the evidence supplied by the even-beat rhythms is
especially valuable. This is so, chiefly because it is much more
difficult to make the word-accent agree with the verse-accent in this
kind of rhythm, in which it<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_172" id="Pg_172" title="172"></a> is essential that accented and unaccented
syllables should alternate continuously, than in the alliterative line,
which allows greater freedom both in the relative position of accented
and unaccented syllables and in the numerical proportion between the
unaccented and the accented syllables.</p>

<p>In the alliterative line the position of the rhythmic accent depends on
the accent of the words which make up the verse. In the even-beat metres
on the other hand the regular succession of thesis and arsis is the
ruling principle of the versification, on which the rhythmic accent
depends, and it is the poet’s task to choose his words according to that
requirement. The difficulties to be surmounted in order to bring the
word-accent into conformity with the verse-accent will frequently drive
the poet using this kind of rhythm to do violence to the accented and,
more frequently still, to the unaccented syllables of the word. He will
be induced either to contract the unaccented syllables with the accented
ones, or to elide the former altogether, or to leave it to the reader to
make the word-accent agree with the verse-accent by making use of level
stress, or by slurring over syllables, or by admitting disyllabic or
even polysyllabic theses in a verse. On the other hand, the poet who
writes in the native alliterative long line or in any of its descendants
is allowed as a rule to use the words required for his verse in their
usual accentuation or syllabic value, or at least in a way approximating
very closely to their ordinary treatment in prose. Hence those
unaccented syllables which, in even-beat rhythms, are found to be
subjected to the same treatment (i.e. to be equally liable to slurring,
elision, syncopation, or apocopation, according to the requirements of
the verse) must be presumed to have been at least approximately equal in
degree of accentual force.</p>

<p>Now when we examine the relation between word-accent and verse-accent in
certain poetical works of the first half of the thirteenth century, viz.
the <cite>Ormulum</cite> (which on account of its regularity of rhythm is our best
guide), the <cite>Pater Noster</cite>, the <cite>Moral Ode</cite>, the <cite>Passion</cite>, and other
poems, we arrive at the following <span class="locked">results:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><a name="section114" id="section114"></a>
§ <b>114.</b> The difference in degree of stress among inflexional endings
containing an <em>e</em> (sometimes <em>i</em> or another vowel) which is alleged by
some scholars&mdash;viz. that such endings (in disyllabic words) have
secondary stress when the root-syllable is long, and are wholly
unaccented when it is short&mdash;has no existence: in both cases the endings
are to be regarded as alike unaccented. For we find that in even-beat
measures<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_173" id="Pg_173" title="173"></a>(especially in the <cite>Ormulum</cite>) these endings, whether attached
to a long or to a short root-syllable, are treated precisely alike in
the following important <span class="locked">respects:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. Those inflexional endings which normally occur in the thesis, and
which are naturally suited for that position, are found in the arsis
only in an extremely small number of instances, which must undoubtedly
be imputed to lack of skill on the part of the poet, as e.g. in
<em>hallȝhé</em> Orm. 70, <em>nemmnéd</em> ib. 75, whereas this is very frequent in
those disyllabic compounds, the second part of which really has a
secondary accent, as e.g. <em>larspéll</em> ib. 51, <em>mannkínn</em> ib. 277.</p>

<p>2. It is no less remarkable, however, that such syllables as those last
mentioned, which undoubtedly bear a secondary accent, are never used by
Orm to form the catalectic end of the septenary verse, evidently because
they would in consequence of their specially strong accent annul or at
least injure the regular unaccented feminine verse-ending. On the other
hand, inflexional endings and unaccented terminations containing an <em>e</em>
are generally used for that purpose, as on account of their lightness of
sound they do not endanger in any way the feminine ending of the
catalectic section of the verse. In any case, inflexional syllables
following upon long root-syllables cannot have the same degree of
stress, and cannot be used for the same rhythmic functions, as the
end-syllables of disyllabic compounds, which undoubtedly bear a
secondary accent.</p>

<p>The <em>regular</em> rhythmic employment of the two last-mentioned groups of
syllables proves their characteristic difference of stress&mdash;the former
being wholly unaccented, the latter bearing a secondary accent. Further
inquiry into the <em>irregular</em> rhythmic employment of the two similar
classes of inflexional endings, those following upon long
root-syllables, and those following upon short ones, tends to prove no
less precisely that they do not differ in degree of stress, and so that
they are both unaccented. For it is easy to show that with regard to
syncope, apocope, elision, and slurring they are treated quite in the
same way.</p>

<p>Elision of the final <em>-e</em> before a vowel or an <em>h</em> takes place quite in
the same way in those inflexional syllables following upon long
root-syllables as it does in those less numerous syllables which follow
upon short ones, e.g. <em>Annd ȝétt ter tákenn marẹ inóh</em> Orm. 37; <em>Wiþþ
állẹ swillc rímẹ alls hér iss sétt</em> ib. 101; <em>For áll þat ǽfrẹ onn érþẹ
is néd</em> ib. 121; <em>a wíntrẹ and éc a lóre</em> Moral Ode 1; <em>Wel lóngẹ ic
hábbe chíld ibíen</em> ib. 3; <em>Icc háfẹ itt dón forrþí þatt áll</em> Orm. 115,
&amp;c. It is the same<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_174" id="Pg_174" title="174"></a> with apocopation: <em>Forr gluternésse wácneþþ áll
Galnésses láþe strénncþe, Annd állẹ þe flǽshess kággerleȝȝc Annd álle
fúle lússtess</em> Orm. 11653&ndash;6; cf. also: <em>þatt hé wass hófenn úpp to kíng</em>
ib. 8450, and <em>wass hófenn úpp to kínge</em> ib. 8370; <em>o fáderr hállf</em> ib.
2269, and <em>o fáderr hállfe</em> 2028, &amp;c.; similarly with syncopation, cf.
<em>ȝiff þú seȝȝst tátt</em> ib. 5188, and <em>annd séȝȝest swíllc</em> ib. 1512; <em>þet
scúlen bén to déaþe idémd</em> Moral Ode 106; <em>for bétere is án elmésse
bifóren</em> ib. 26, &amp;c.; and again with the slurring of syllables following
upon long as well as upon short root-syllables, as the following
examples occurring in the first acatalectic sections of septenary verse
will show sufficiently: <em>Ál þet bétste þét we héfden</em> Moral Ode 51;
<em>Gódes wísdom ís wel míchel</em> ib. 213, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Now as a syllable bearing a secondary accent cannot become mute, as an
unaccented syllable does, if required, it is evident that those
inflexional syllables which follow upon long root-syllables and
frequently do become silent cannot bear that secondary accent which has
been ascribed to them by several scholars; on the contrary, all
syllables subject in the same way to elision, apocope, syncope, and
slurring must have the same degree of stress (i.e. they must be alike
unaccented) whether preceded by short or by long root-syllables.</p>

<p>Other terminations of disyllabic words which, though not inflexional,
consist, like the inflexional endings, of <em>e</em> + consonant, are treated
in the same way, e.g. words like <em>fader</em>, <em>moder</em>, <em>finger</em>, <em>heven</em>,
<em>sadel</em>, <em>giver</em>, &amp;c. Only those inflexional and derivational endings
which are of a somewhat fuller sound, as e.g., <em>-ing</em>, <em>-ling</em>, <em>-ung</em>,
<em>-and</em>, <em>-ish</em>, and now and then even the comparative and superlative
endings <em>-er</em>, <em>-est</em>, and the suffixes <em>-lic</em>, <em>-lich</em>, <em>-ly</em>, <em>-y</em>,
may be looked upon as bearing a secondary accent, as they may be used at
will either in the arsis of the verse or lowered to the state of
unaccented syllables as the thesis.</p>

<p><a name="section115" id="section115"></a>
§ <b>115.</b> In a trisyllabic simple word the root-syllable, of course, has
the primary accent, and of the two following syllables, that which has
the fuller sound, has the secondary accent, as in <em>áskedèst</em>,
<em>wrítìnge</em>, <em>dággère</em>, <em>clénnèsse</em>, <em>híèste</em>. If, however, the two last
syllables are equally destitute of word-accent, as e.g. in <em>clepede</em>,
<em>lufede</em>, they are both metrically unaccented; and, as mentioned before
(cf. § <a href="#section96">96</a>), may be shortened either to <em>lufde</em>, <em>clepte</em>, or to <em>lufed</em>,
<em>cleped</em>. If they are used, however, as trisyllables in the iambic
rhythm they naturally admit of the metrical accent on the last syllable.</p>

<p>It is the same with compounds of nouns or adjectives. The first syllable
takes the chief accent, and of the two others that<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_175" id="Pg_175" title="175"></a> has the secondary
accent which is the root-syllable of the second part of the compound, as
in <em>fréendshìpe</em>, <em>shírrève</em>, but <em>wódecràft</em>, <em>bóldelỳ</em>.</p>

<p>In verbal compounds the primary accent, in conformity with the Old
English usage, generally rests on the root-syllable of the verb, while
the first and last syllable are mostly unaccented, as e.g. <em>alihten</em>,
<em>bisechen</em>, <em>forgiven</em>, <em>ibidden</em>, <em>ofþunchen</em>. In denominatives, which
in Old English have the primary accent on the first syllable, as e.g.
<em>ándswarian</em>, both kinds of accentuation are allowed: <em>ánswere</em> and
<em>answére</em>.</p>

<p>In disyllabic and trisyllabic compounds of nouns with certain prefixes,
partly accented in Old English, as e.g. <em>al-</em>, <em>un-</em>, <em>for-</em>, <em>mis-</em>,
<em>y-</em>, <em>a-</em>, <em>bi-</em>, the primary accent does not rest on these syllables,
but on the second syllable, this being the root-syllable of the word,
e.g. <em>almíhti</em>, <em>forgétful</em>, <em>unhéele</em>, <em>bihéeste</em>; the first syllable
in this case bears a secondary accent if it has a determinative
signification, as e.g. <em>al-</em>, <em>mis-</em>, <em>un-</em>, but it is unaccented if it
is indifferent to the meaning, as e.g. <em>a-</em>, <em>y-</em>, <em>bi-</em></p>

<p><a name="section116" id="section116"></a>
§ <b>116.</b> A peculiar rhythmical position is held by those words which we
may call parathetic compounds.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> To these belong certain compound
nouns formed by two words of almost the same weight from a syntactical
and metrical point of view, as e.g. <em>goodman</em>, <em>goodwyf</em>, <em>longswerd</em>,
and also by similar composite particles, as e.g. <em>elleswhere</em>, <em>also</em>,
<em>into</em>, <em>unto</em>. Although the regular colloquial pronunciation was
probably in the Middle English period, as it is in Modern English, with
the accent on the first syllable, they may be pronounced with the accent
on the second syllable, or at least with level stress, as e.g.
<em>g</em>oo<em>dm</em>á<em>n</em>, a<em>ls</em>ó, i<em>nt</em>ó, &amp;c. To this class also belong certain
compounds of adverbs with prepositions, as e.g. <em>herein</em>, <em>therefore</em>,
<em>thereof</em>, the only difference being that the usual accent rests here on
the last syllable, but may be placed also on the first, as in <em>hereín</em>
and <em>hérein</em>, <em>thereóf</em> and <em>théreof</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="section117" id="section117"></a>
§ <b>117.</b> These gradations of sound in the different words regulate their
rhythmical treatment in the verse. In disyllabic words as a rule the
syllable with the primary accent is placed in the arsis of the verse,
the other syllable, whether it be an unaccented one, or have a secondary
accent, is placed in the thesis. Such words as those described in the
preceding section may much<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_176" id="Pg_176" title="176"></a> more easily be used with level stress than
others. In that case the rhythmical accent rests on the syllable which
has the secondary accent, while the syllable which in ordinary speech
has the chief accent is used as a thesis.</p>

<p>The ordinary as well as the abnormal use of one and the
same word will be illustrated by the following <span class="locked">example:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">O mánnkinn swá þatt ítt mannkínn. <span class="attrib">Orm. 277.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>With regard to the rhythmical treatment of trisyllables two classes of
such words are to be distinguished, namely, (1) those in which the
syllable bearing the primary accent is followed or (rarely) preceded by
a syllable bearing a secondary accent, as e.g. <em>gódspèlles</em>, <em>énglìshe</em>,
and (2) those in which the syllable bearing the primary accent is
preceded or followed by a syllable wholly unaccented, as e.g.
<em>bigínnen</em>, <em>òvercóme</em>, <em>crístendòm</em>, <em>wéathercòck</em>. In the latter case
level stress is hardly ever met with, as the natural word-accent would
be interfered with to an intolerable extent by accentuations like
<em>cristéndom</em>, <em>weathércock</em>, <em>ovércome</em>, <em>bíginnén</em>, <em>fórgottén</em>,
<em>béhavióur</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Words like these therefore can in regular iambic or trochaic verse be
used only with their natural accentuation, and hence those syllables
which either have the primary or the secondary accent are always placed
in the arsis, and the unaccented ones in the thesis, e.g.: <em>To wínnenn
únnder Crísstenndóm</em> Orm. Ded. 137; <em>off þátt itt wáss bigúnnenn</em> ib.
88; <em>Though the séas thréaten, théy are mércifúl</em> Shakesp. Temp. <span class="fakesc">V.</span> 178;
<em>Ónly compóund me wíth forgótten dúst</em> id. 2 Hen. IV, <span class="fakesc">IV.</span> v. 116, &amp;c. On
the other hand, when primary and secondary accent occur in two adjacent
syllables level stress is very common, in Middle English, especially
between the first and the second syllable, as <em>g</em>o<em>dspélles hállȝhe
láre</em> Orm. 14, more rarely between the second and the third syllable, as
<em>þa Góddsp</em>e<em>ll</em>é<em>ss neh álle</em> ib. 30; it also occurs in Chaucer’s
poems, as <em>For thóus</em>a<em>nd</em>é<em>s his hóndes máden dýe</em> Troil. v. 1816; in
the same way Modern English words are treated to fit the rhythm, as e.g.
<em>mídsùmmer</em>, <em>faíntheàrted</em>, in <em>Farewéll</em>, <em>f</em>á<em>int-h</em>éa<em>rted ánd
degénerate kíng</em> Shak. 3 Hen. VI. <span class="fakesc"> I.</span> i. 138; <em>And górgeous ás the sún at
míds</em>u<em>mm</em>é<em>r</em> 1 Hen. IV, <span class="fakesc">IV.</span> i. 102. With the more recent poets this
latter kind of rhythmical accentuation becomes the more usual of the
two, although the nature and the meaning of the compound word always
play an important part in such cases.</p>

<p>With regard to their accentuation and metrical employment words of four
syllables also fall into three classes: 1. Inflected<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_177" id="Pg_177" title="177"></a> forms of words
belonging to the first group of trisyllables, like <em>crístendómes</em>, which
can be used in the rhythm of the verse only with their natural
accentuation; 2. words like <em>fordémde</em> (first and last syllable
unaccented, the second syllable having the chief accent) with a
determinative prefix, as e.g. <em>únfordémde</em>; these likewise are used in
the rhythm of the verse according to their natural accentuation; 3.
words of the third group with a prefix which either has the secondary
accent, or is unaccented, as <em>ùnwíslìce</em> or <em>iwítnèsse</em>; the metrical
usage of these is regulated according to the rules for the trisyllabic
words. The same is to be observed with regard to words of five and six
syllables like <em>únderstándìnge</em>, <em>únimételiche</em>, which, however, are
only of rare occurrence.</p>

<p><a name="section118" id="section118"></a>
§ <b>118. B. Romanic words.</b> It was not till the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries that Romanic words passed in considerable numbers into the
English language; and they were then accommodated to the general laws of
accentuation of English. The transition, however, from Romanic to
Germanic accentuation certainly did not take place at once, but
gradually, and earlier in some districts and in some classes of society
than in others; in educated circles undoubtedly later than amongst the
common people. The accentuation of the newly introduced Romanic words
thus being in a vacillating state, we easily see how the poets writing
at that period in foreign even-beat rhythms, of whom Chaucer may serve
as a representative, could use those words with whichever accentuation
best suited their need at the moment, admitting the Romanic accentuation
chiefly in rhymes, where it afforded them great facilities, and the
usual Germanic accentuation mostly in the interior of the line. A few
examples will suffice to illustrate this well-known fact. We arrange
them in five classes according to the number of syllables in the words;
the principles of metrical accentuation not being precisely identical in
the several classes.</p>

<p><b>Disyllabic words.</b> I. Words whose final syllable is accented in
French. They are used in even-beat rhythms (1) with the original
accentuation, e.g. <em>prisóun: raunsóun</em> Kn. T. 317&ndash;18; <em>pítouslý :
mercý</em> ib. 91&ndash;2; <em>pitóus: móus</em> Prol. 143&ndash;4; (2) with the accent on the
first syllable according to the accentuation which had already become
prevalent in ordinary English speech, e.g. <em>This prísoun cáusede me</em> Kn.
T. 237; <em>With hérte pítous</em> ib. 95; <em>But wé beséken mércy ánd socóur</em>
ib. 60.</p>

<p>II. Words having in French the accent on the first syllable, the last
syllable being unaccented. These words, partly<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_178" id="Pg_178" title="178"></a> substantives or
adjectives, as <em>people</em>, <em>nombre</em>, <em>propre</em>, partly verbs, as <em>praye</em>,
<em>suffre</em>, <em>crie</em> (in which case the accentuation of the sing. of the
present tense prevails), are always used in verse with the original
accentuation, the second unaccented syllable either (1) forming a full
thesis of the verse, as in <em>the péple préseth thíderward</em> Kn. T. 1672;
<em>bý his própre gód</em> Prol. 581, or (2) being elided or slurred and
forming only part of the thesis, as in <em>the nómbre and éek the cáuse</em>
ib. 716; <em>and crýe as hé were wóod</em> ib. 636.</p>

<p>As a rule also the original and usual accent is retained by disyllabic
words containing an unaccented prefix, as in <em>accord</em>, <em>abet</em>, <em>desyr</em>,
<em>defence</em>, &amp;c. Only words composed with the prefix <em>dis-</em> occur with
either accentuation, as <em>díscreet</em> and <em>discréet</em>.</p>

<p><a name="section119" id="section119"></a>
§ <b>119. Trisyllabic words.</b> I. Words, the last syllable of which in
French has the chief accent, the first having a secondary accent. In
these words the two accents are transposed in English, so that the first
syllable bears the chief accent, the last the secondary accent, and both
of them as a rule receive the rhythmical accent: <em>émperóur</em>, <em>árgumént</em>.
But if two syllables of such a word form a disyllabic thesis, generally
the last syllable which has the secondary accent is lowered to the
unaccented grade: <em>árgument</em>, <em>émperour</em>.</p>

<p>II. Words which in French have the chief accent on the middle syllable,
the last being unaccented. These are sometimes used with the original
accentuation, mostly as feminine rhymes, e.g.: <em>viságe: uságe</em> Prol.
109&ndash;10; <em>chére: manére</em> ib. 139&ndash;40; <em>penánce: pitánce</em> ib. 233&ndash;4;
<em>poráille: vitáille</em> ib. 247&ndash;8; <em>prudénce: senténce</em> ib. 305&ndash;6;
<em>offíce: áccomplíce</em> Kn. T. 2005&ndash;6, &amp;c.; more rarely in the interior of
the verse, where the last syllable may either form a thesis as in <em>Ál
your plesánce férme and stáble I hólde</em> Cl. T. 663, or part of it, being
elided or slurred, as in <em>The sáme lúst was híre plesánce alsó</em> ib. 717.
In other instances, mostly in the interior of the verse, they have the
accent on the first syllable, the last being always elided or slurred:
<em>And sáugh his vísage was in anóther kýnde</em> Kn. T. 543; <em>He fél in
óffice wíth a chámberléyn</em> ib. 561.</p>

<p>Verbs ending in <em>-ice</em> (<em>-isse</em>), <em>-ishe</em>, <em>-ie</em>, as e.g. <em>chérisse</em>,
<em>púnishe</em>, <em>stúdie</em>, <em>cárrie</em>, <em>tárrie</em>, nearly always have the accent
on the first syllable, the last syllable being elided or apocopated,
except where it is strengthened by a final consonant, as e.g.
<em>chérishëd</em>, <em>tárriëd</em>. If the first syllable of a trisyllabic word be
formed by an unaccented particle, the root-syllable of the word, in
this<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_179" id="Pg_179" title="179"></a> case the middle one, likewise retains the accent, as e.g. in
<em>despíse</em>, <em>remaíne</em>.</p>

<p><a name="section120" id="section120"></a>
§ <b>120. Four-syllable words</b> of French origin when they are
substantives or adjectives frequently have disyllabic or trisyllabic
suffixes such as: <em>-age</em>, <em>-iage</em>, <em>-ian</em>, <em>-iant</em>, <em>-aunce</em>, <em>-iance</em>,
<em>-iaunce</em>, <em>-ence</em>, <em>-ience</em>, <em>-ient</em>, <em>-ier</em>, <em>-ioun</em>, <em>-ious</em>,
<em>-eous</em>, <em>-uous</em>, <em>-ial</em>, <em>-ual</em>, <em>-iat</em>, <em>-iour</em>, <em>-ure</em>, <em>-ie</em> (<em>-ye</em>).
As most of these words already have a trochaic or iambic rhythm, they
are used without difficulty in even-beat disyllabic verses, chiefly in
rhymes, and then always with their full syllabic value, as e.g.:
<em>pílgrimáge: coráge</em> Prol. 11&ndash;12; <em>hóstelrýe: cómpanýe</em> ib. 23&ndash;4;
<em>resóun: condícióun</em> ib. 37&ndash;8; <em>chývalrýe: cúrtesýe</em> ib. 45&ndash;6;
<em>chívachíe: Pícardíe</em> ib. 185&ndash;6; <em>cónsciénce: réverénce</em> ib. 141&ndash;2;
<em>tóun: conféssióun</em> ib. 217&ndash;18; <em>curát: licénciát</em> 219&ndash;20; <em>góvernáunce
: chévysáunce</em> ib. 291&ndash;2, &amp;c. In the interior of a verse also the words
not ending in an unaccented <em>e</em> are always metrically treated according
to their full syllabic value, e.g.: <em>That héeld opínyóun that pléyn
delýt</em> Prol. 337; <em>Of hís compléxióun he wás sangwýn</em> ib. 333. In those
words, on the other hand, which end in an unaccented <em>e</em>, this vowel is
in the interior of the verse generally elided or apocopated: <em>no vílanýe
is ít</em> ib. 740; <em>ín that óstelríe alíght</em> ib. 720; <em>So móche of
dáliáunce and fáir langáge</em> ib. 211; <em>And ál was cónsciénce and téndre
hérte</em> ib. 150.</p>

<p>Further shortenings, however, which transform an originally
four-syllable word into a disyllabic one, as in the present
pronunciation of the word <em>conscience</em>, do not take lace in Middle
English before the transition to the Modern English period. In
Lyndesay’s <cite>Monarchie</cite> we meet with accentuations of this kind, as e.g.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">The quhílk gaif sápience tó king Sálomóne. <span class="attrib">249.</span></div>

    <div class="line">Be tháy contént, mak réverence tó the rést. <span class="attrib">36.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In a similar way adjectives ending in <em>-able</em> and verbs ending in
<em>-ice</em>, <em>-ye</em> adapt themselves to the disyllabic rhythm, and likewise
verbs ending in <em>-ine</em> (Old French <em>-iner</em>); only it must be noticed
that in the preterite and in the past participle verbs of the latter
class tend to throw the accents on the antepenultimate and last
syllables, e.g. <em>enlúminéd</em>, <em>emprísonéd</em>.

<b>Words of five syllables</b> almost without exception have an iambic rhythm
of themselves and are used accordingly in even-beat verses, as e.g.
<em>expériénce</em>; the same is the case with words which have Germanic
endings, like <em>-ing</em>, <em>-inge</em>, <em>-nesse</em>, e.g. <em>discónfytýnge</em>.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_180" id="Pg_180" title="180"></a></p>

<p>The rhythmic accentuation of foreign proper names both in disyllables
and in polysyllables varies. Thus we may notice the accentuations
<em>Junó</em>, <em>Plató</em>, <em>Venús</em>, and, on the other hand, <em>Júno</em>, <em>Pláto</em>,
<em>Vénus</em>; <em>Arcíte</em>, <em>Athénes</em>, and <em>Árcíte</em>, <em>Áthenes</em>; <em>Antónie</em> and
<em>Ántoníe</em>. Wherever in such cases level stress may help to smooth the
rhythm it certainly is to be assumed in reading.</p>


<h4>II. Word-accent in Modern English</h4>

<p><a name="section121" id="section121"></a>
§ <b>121.</b> Modern English accentuation deviates little from that of the
Old English and Middle English; the inflexional endings, however, play a
much less important part; further, in many cases the Romanic
accentuation of Middle English is still in existence, or at least has
influence, in words of French or Latin origin. This is evident from many
deviations in the rhythmic accentuation of such words from the modern
accentuation which we here regard as normal, though it is to be noted
that in the beginning of the Modern English epoch, i.e. in the sixteenth
century, the actual accentuation in many cases was still in conformity
with the earlier conditions.</p>

<p>Only these real and apparent anomalies are noticed here. We have first
to consider the <b>Romanic endings</b> <em>-ace</em>, <em>-age</em>, <em>-ail</em>, <em>-el</em>, <em>-ain</em>,
<em>-al</em>, <em>-ance</em>, <em>-ence</em>, <em>-ant</em>, <em>-ent</em>, <em>-er</em>, <em>-ess</em> (Old French
<em>-esse</em>), <em>-ice</em>, <em>-ile</em>, <em>-in</em>, <em>-on</em>, <em>-or</em>, <em>-our</em>, <em>-une</em>, <em>-ure</em>,
<em>-y</em>(<em>e</em>) (in disyllabic words). As the final <em>e</em> has become mute, all
these endings are monosyllabic.</p>

<p>In the works of the earlier Modern English poets some words ending in
these syllables are only exceptionally used with the accent on the last
syllable according to the Old French or Middle English accentuation, the
Modern English accentuation being the usual one; others are employed
more frequently or even exclusively with the earlier accentuation, e.g.
<em>paláce</em> Sur. 174, <em>bondáge</em> Wyatt 224, <em>traváil</em> Sur. 82, Wyatt 19,
<em>certáin</em> ib. 179, <em>mountáin</em> Sur. 37, <em>chieftáin</em> ib. 112, <em>cristál</em>
Wyatt 156, <em>presénce</em> ib. 81, <em>grievánce</em> ib. 55, <em>penánce</em> ib. 209,
<em>balánce</em> ib. 173, <em>pleasánt</em> ib. 130, <em>tormént</em> (subst.) ib. 72,
<em>fevér</em>, <em>fervóur</em> ib. 210, <em>mistréss</em> ib. 109, <em>richés</em> ib. 209,
<em>justíce</em> ib. 229, <em>servíce</em> ib. 177, <em>engíne</em> Sur. 130, <em>seasón</em> ib.
149, <em>honóur</em> ib. 166, <em>armóur</em> 148, <em>colóur</em>: <em>therefóre</em> Wyatt 6,
<em>terrór</em>: <em>succóur</em> ib. 210, &amp;c., <em>fortúne</em>: <em>tune</em> ib. 152, Sur. 115,
<em>measúre</em> Wyatt 125, <em>natúre</em>: <em>unsúre</em> ib. 144, <em>glorý</em>: <em>mercý</em> ib.
208.</p>

<p>In almost all these cases and in many other words with the same endings
this accentuation seems to be due to the requirements of the rhythm, in
which case level stress must be assumed.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_181" id="Pg_181" title="181"></a></p>

<p><a name="section122" id="section122"></a>
§ <b>122.</b> It is the same with many other disyllabic words, especially
those both syllables of which are almost of equal sound-value and degree
of stress, as in cases in which two different meanings of one and the
same word are indicated by different accentuation, a distinction not
unfrequently neglected in the metrical treatment of these words.</p>

<p>So the following adjectives and participles are used by Shakespeare and
other poets with variable accentuation: <em>complete</em>, <em>adverse</em>, <em>benign</em>,
<em>contrived</em>, <em>corrupt</em>, <em>despised</em>, <em>dispersed</em>, <em>distinct</em>, <em>distract</em>,
<em>diverse</em>, <em>eterne</em>, <em>exact</em>, <em>exhaled</em>, <em>exiled</em>, <em>expired</em>, <em>express</em>,
<em>extreme</em>, <em>famous</em>, <em>insane</em>, <em>invised</em>, <em>misplaced</em>, <em>misprised</em>,
<em>obscure</em>, <em>perfect</em>, <em>profane</em>, <em>profound</em>, <em>remiss</em>, <em>secure</em>,
<em>severe</em>, <em>sincere</em>, <em>supreme</em>, <em>terrene</em>; and so are also the many
adjectives and participles compounded with the prefix <em>un-</em>, as e.g.
<em>unborn</em>, <em>unchaste</em>, <em>unkind</em>, &amp;c. (cf. Alexander Schmidt,
<cite>Shakespeare-Lexicon</cite>).</p>

<p>Substantives and verbs are treated in a similar way, e.g. <em>c</em>o<em>mf</em>ó<em>rt</em>
(subst.) Wyatt 14, <em>r</em>e<em>c</em>ó<em>rd</em> ib. 156, <em>d</em>i<em>sc</em>ó<em>rd</em> Sur. 6,
<em>c</em>o<em>nfl</em>í<em>ct</em> ib. 85, <em>p</em>u<em>rcháse</em> ib. 58, <em>m</em>i<em>sch</em>íe<em>f</em> Wyatt 78,
<em>s</em>a<em>fegu</em>á<em>rd</em> ib. 212, <em>M</em>a<em>d</em>á<em>me</em> ib. 149, <em>pr</em>o<em>m</em>é<em>ss</em> ib. 25. So
also in Shakespeare (cf. Alexander Schmidt, l.c.): á<em>cc</em>e<em>ss</em>,
a<em>sp</em>é<em>ct</em>, <em>c</em>o<em>mm</em>é<em>rce</em>, <em>c</em>o<em>ns</em>ó<em>rt</em>, <em>c</em>o<em>ntr</em>á<em>ct</em>,
<em>c</em>o<em>mp</em>á<em>ct</em>, e<em>d</em>í<em>ct</em>, i<em>nst</em>í<em>nct</em>, ou<em>tr</em>á<em>ge</em>, <em>pr</em>e<em>c</em>é<em>pts</em>,
<em>c</em>é<em>m</em>e<em>nt</em>, <em>c</em>ó<em>nd</em>u<em>ct</em> (vb.), <em>c</em>ó<em>nf</em>i<em>ne</em>, <em>p</em>ú<em>rs</em>ue,
<em>r</em>é<em>l</em>a<em>pse</em> (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii. § 62)</p>

<p><a name="section123" id="section123"></a>
§ <b>123.</b> Trisyllabic and polysyllabic words, too, of French or Latin
origin are still used frequently in the beginning of the Modern English
period with an accentuation contrary to present usage. Words e.g. which
now have the chief accent on the second syllable, the first and third
syllable being unaccented, are often used with the rhythmical accents on
these two syllables, e.g.: <em>c</em>ó<em>nf</em>e<em>ss</em>ó<em>r</em> Meas. <span class="fakesc">IV.</span> iii. 133, <em>c</em>ó<em>nt</em>i<em>n</em>úe
Wyatt 189; <em>d</em>é<em>p</em>a<em>rt</em>ú<em>re</em> ib. 129; <em>r</em>é<em>p</em>e<em>nt</em>á<em>nce</em> ib. 205, é<em>nd</em>ea<em>v</em>óu<em>r</em> ib.
232; <em>d</em>é<em>t</em>e<em>st</em>á<em>ble</em> John <span class="fakesc">III.</span> iv. 29, <em>rh</em>éu<em>m</em>a<em>t</em>í<em>c</em> Ven. 135, &amp;c. Likewise
in words the first and third syllables of which are now accented and the
second unaccented, the rhythmical accent is placed on this very
syllable, e.g. <em>charácter</em> Lucr. 807, <em>confíscate</em> Cymb. <span class="fakesc">V.</span> v. 323,
<em>contráry</em> Wyatt 8, <em>impórtune</em> Ant. <span class="fakesc">IV.</span> xv. 19, <em>oppórtune</em> Temp. IV.
i. 26, <em>perséver</em> All’s Well <span class="fakesc">IV.</span> ii. 37, <em>prescíence</em> Troil. <span class="fakesc">I.</span> iii.
199, <em>siníster</em> Troil. <span class="fakesc">IV.</span> v. 128. Certain verbs also in <em>-ise</em>, <em>-ize</em>
are used with fluctuating accentuation; Shakespeare e.g. always has
<em>advértise</em> Meas. i. 142, <em>authórise</em> Sonn. 35, <em>canónize</em> Troil. II.
ii. 202; sometimes also <em>solémnize</em> Temp. v. 309 (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii. §§
64, 65).</p>

<p>Foreign proper names especially in many cases are subject, as in earlier
times, to variable accentuation, as e.g.: <em>Ajáx</em> Sur.<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_182" id="Pg_182" title="182"></a>129, <em>Cæsár</em>
Wyatt 191, <em>Cató</em> ib. 191, the more usual accentuation also occurring in
the writings of the same poets; similarly <em>Átridés</em> Sur. 129 and
<em>Atríde</em> ib. 116, <em>Cárthages</em> ib. 149 and <em>Cartháge</em> 175. Shakespeare
has always the unclassical <em>Andrónicus</em>, <em>Hypérion</em>, <em>Cleopátra</em>, but
for rhythmical reasons <em>N</em>ó<em>rth</em>a<em>mpt</em>ó<em>n</em> Rich. III, <span class="fakesc">II.</span> iv. 1 instead of
<em>Northámpton</em>, and so in several other cases (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii. § 67)</p>

<p><a name="section124" id="section124"></a>
§ <b>124.</b> Amongst the <b>Germanic vocables</b> the parathetic compounds
chiefly call for notice, as their accentuation in common speech also
approaches level stress, and for this reason they may be used with
either accentuation. This group includes compounds like <em>moonlight</em>,
<em>welfare</em>, <em>farewell</em>, and some conjunctions, prepositions, and
pronouns, as <em>therefore</em>, <em>wherefore</em>, <em>something</em>, <em>nothing</em>,
<em>sometimes</em>, <em>into</em>, <em>unto</em>, <em>towards</em>, <em>without</em>, as e.g.: <em>thérefore</em>
Wyatt 24, &amp;c., <em>therefóre</em> ib. 42, <em>nóthing</em> Rich. II, <span class="fakesc">II.</span> ii. 12,
<em>nothíng</em> Rich. III, <span class="fakesc">I.</span> i. 236, <em>únto</em> Sur. 125, <em>untó</em> Sur. 117 (cf.
<cite>Metrik</cite>, ii. § 58).</p>

<p>Greater arbitrariness in the treatment of word-accent, explained best by
the influence of Middle English usage, is shown in the rhythmical
accentuation of the final syllable <em>-ing</em> in words like <em>endíng</em>:
<em>thing</em> Wyatt 27; and of the suffixes <em>-ness</em>, <em>-ly</em>, <em>-y</em>, <em>-ow</em>, e.g.
<em>goodnéss</em>: <em>excéss</em> Wyatt 206, <em>free</em>: <em>trulý</em> 147; <em>borrów</em>: <em>sorrów</em>:
<em>overthrów</em> ib. 227. Less admissible still are such accentuations with
the endings <em>-er</em>, <em>-est</em>, used on the whole only by the earlier Modern
English poets, e.g. <em>earnést</em> Wyatt 11, <em>aftér</em> ib. 207, and least of
all with inflexional endings, e.g. <em>scornéd</em> Sur. 170, <em>causéth</em> Wyatt
33 (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii. §§ 59&ndash;61).</p>

<p>As a rule, however, such unnatural accentuations can be avoided by
assuming the omission of a thesis at the beginning or in the interior of
a line. With regard to trisyllabic and polysyllabic words the remarks on
pp. 176&ndash;7 are to be compared.</p>

Modern English Periods</span><br />

CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="subtitle">LINES OF EIGHT FEET, FOUR FEET, TWO FEET,<br />
  AND ONE FOOT</span></h3>

<p><a name="section125" id="section125"></a>
§ <b>125.</b> Among the metres introduced into Middle English poetry in
imitation of foreign models, perhaps the oldest is the four-foot verse,
rhyming in couplets. This metre may be regarded as having originally
arisen by halving the eight-foot line, although only an isolated example
of this, dating from about the middle of the thirteenth century, quoted
above (p. <a href="#Pg_127">127</a>), is known in Middle English poetry. This, however, serves
with special clearness to illustrate the resolution, by means of
inserted rhyme, of the eight-foot long-line couplet into four-foot lines
rhyming alternately (cf. § <a href="#section78">78</a>).</p>

<p>In the manuscript the verses, though rhyming in long lines, are written
as short lines, with intermittent rhyme <em>a b c b d b e b</em>, just as the
example of Modern English eight-foot iambic verse, quoted before (p.
<a href="#Pg_127">127</a>), is found printed with this arrangement, as is indeed generally the
case with most long-line forms of that type. This metre calls for no
other remarks on its rhythmical structure than will have to be made with
regard to the four-foot verse.</p>

<p><a name="section126" id="section126"></a>
§ <b>126.</b> The four-foot line, rhyming in couplets, first appears in a
paraphrase of the <cite>Pater Noster</cite> of the end of the twelfth century,<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
doubtless in imitation of the Old French <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vers octosyllabe</em> made known
in England by Anglo-Norman poets, such as Gaimar, Wace, Benoit, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This French metre consists of eight syllables when the ending is
monosyllabic, and nine when it is disyllabic.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_184" id="Pg_184" title="184"></a></p>

<p>The lines are always connected in couplets by rhyme, but masculine and
feminine rhymes need not alternate with one another.</p>

<p>It is exactly the same with the Middle English four-foot line, except
that the rising iambic rhythm comes out more clearly in it, and that,
instead of the Romanic principle of counting the syllables, that of the
equality of beats is perceptible, so that the equality of the number of
syllables in the verses is not so strictly observed. Hence, all the
deviations before mentioned from the strict formal structure of
even-beat verses occur even in this early poem, and quite regularly
constructed couplets are indeed but rare in it. Examples of this type
are the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Ah, láverd gód, her úre béne,</div>
    <div class="line">Of úre súnne máke us cléne,</div>
    <div class="line">Þet hé us ȝéue alswá he méi,</div>
    <div class="line">Þet ús bihóueð úlche déi. &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="normal">ll. 167&ndash;170.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The first ten lines of the poem give a sufficient idea of the structure
of the verse, and its characteristics:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Ure féder þét in héouene ís,</div>
    <div class="line">Þet ís all sóþ fúl iwís!</div>
    <div class="line">Weo móten tó þeos wéordes iséon,</div>
    <div class="line">Þet to líue and to sáule góde béon,</div>
    <div class="line">Þet wéo beon swá his súnes ibórene,</div>
    <div class="line">Þet hé beo féder and wé him icórene,</div>
    <div class="line">Þet wé don álle hís ibéden</div>
    <div class="line">Ánd his wílle fór to réden.</div>
    <div class="line">Lóke weo ús wið hím misdón</div>
    <div class="line">Þurh béelzebúbes swíkedóm.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Here we find almost all the rhythmical licences to be found in even-beat
metres. Thus we have suppression of the anacrusis in line 8 and again in
two consecutive lines, such as 15, 16:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Gíf we léornið gódes láre,</div>
    <div class="line">Þénne of-þúnceð hít him sáre;</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>and very often in the course of the poem, e.g. ll. 22, 29, 30, 37, &amp;c.,
so that it acquires a loose, iambic-trochaic cadence; further, the
absence of an unaccented syllable in the middle of the line (line 2);
inversion of accent in line 9, and again in line 81, <em>Láverd he ís of
álle scáfte</em>; two unaccented syllables at the beginning and in the
interior of the verse in 4; light slurrings ll. 1, 3, 5; only ll. 7 and
10 are regularly constructed through<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_185" id="Pg_185" title="185"></a>out. The same proportion of regular
to irregular verses runs through the whole poem, in which, besides the
licences mentioned, that of level stress is also often to be met with,
especially in rhymes like <em>w</em>u<em>rþ</em>í<em>ng: héovenkíng</em> 99&ndash;100; <em>h</em>a<em>t</em>í<em>ng: king</em>
193&ndash;4, 219&ndash;20; <em>fóndúnge: swínkúnge</em> 242&ndash;3.</p>

<p><a name="section127" id="section127"></a>
§ <b>127.</b> The treatment of the caesura in this metre also deserves,
special mention, for this, as has already been stated, is one of the
chief points in which the four-foot even-beat metre differs from the
four-stress metre, as represented either by the old alliterative long
line or by the later non-alliterating line. For there must be a caesura
in every four-beat verse, and it must always be found in one definite
place, viz. after the second beat next to any unaccented syllable or
syllables that follow the beat, the line being thus divided into two
rhythmically fairly equal halves. On the other hand, for the four-foot
verse, not only in this, its earliest appearance, but in the rest of
Middle and Modern English literature, the caesura is not obligatory, and
when it does occur it may, theoretically speaking, stand in any place in
the line, although it most frequently appears after the second foot,
particularly in the oldest period.</p>

<p>The caesura may (§ <a href="#section80">80</a>) be of three kinds:</p>

<p>(1) Monosyllabic or masculine caesura:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Ne képeð he nóht | þet wé beon súne. <span class="normal">&nbsp; &nbsp; 18.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>(2) Disyllabic or feminine caesura, two kinds of which are to
be distinguished, viz.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Lyric caesura, within a foot:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">And ȝéfe us míhte | þúrh his héld.<span class="normal">&nbsp; &nbsp; 240.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>


<p>(<em>b</em>) Epic caesura caused by a supernumerary unaccented
        syllable before the pause:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Ure gúltes, láverd, | bon ús forȝéven. <span class="normal">&nbsp; &nbsp; 173.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>These three kinds of caesura, the last of which, it is true, we meet
here only sporadically, may thus in four-foot verse also occur <em>after</em>,
as well as <em>in</em> the other feet. Thus we find in the very first line, a
lyrical caesura after the first foot:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Ure féder | þét in héouene ís.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This, however, seldom happens in the oldest examples, in which caesuras
sharply dividing the line are rare, enjambement being only seldom
admitted. Examples of verses without<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_186" id="Pg_186" title="186"></a> caesuras are to be found, among
others, in the following: <em>Þúrh béelzebúbes swíkedóm</em> 10, <em>Intó þe
þósternésse héllen</em> 104. As a rule, in the four-foot verse as well as in
French octosyllabics, a pause does not occur until the end, on account
of the shortness of this metre, which generally only suffices for one
rhythmic section, while in four-beat verse a regular division into two
rhythmic sections, and consequently the constant occurrence of a
caesura, is rendered possible by the greater number of unaccented
syllables.</p>

<p>The end of the line may, in any order, have either a masculine rhyme, as
in ll. 1&ndash;4, 9, 10, or a feminine rhyme, as in ll. 7 and 8. There occur
besides, but seldom, trisyllabic rhymes, such as those in ll. 5&ndash;6, or
<em>súnegen: múnegen</em> 141&ndash;2</p>

<p><a name="section128" id="section128"></a>
§ <b>128.</b> This metre continued to be very popular in Middle and Modern
English poetry, and is still extensively used. As a rule its structure
constantly remained the same; nevertheless we may, in both periods,
distinguish between two well-marked ways of treating it. It was, for
instance, at the end of the thirteenth and in the first half of the
fourteenth century, very freely handled in the North of England in the
<cite>Surtees Psalter</cite>, further by Robert Mannyng in his <cite>Handlyng Sinne</cite>,
and by Richard Rolle de Hampole in his <cite>Pricke of Conscience</cite>. Their
treatment of this verse is characterized, for instance, by the
remarkably frequent occurrence of two and even three unaccented
syllables at the beginning and in the middle of the line, e.g.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">In þi rightwísenésses biþénke I sál</div>
    <div class="line">Þine sághes nóght forgéte withál.</div>
       <div class="attribution">Psalm cxviii, v. 16.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">And rékened þe cústome hóuses echóne,</div>
    <div class="line">At whých þey had góde and at whýche nóne.</div>
       <div class="attribution">Mannyng, Handlyng Sinne, ll. 5585&ndash;6.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Other rhythmical licences, such as the omission of unaccented syllables
in the middle of a verse, and inversion of accent, are frequent in these
compositions. Level stress, on the other hand, for the most part is
found only in rhyme, as <em>sh</em>e<em>nsh</em>é<em>pe</em>: <em>kepe</em> Hampole 380&ndash;1; <em>come</em>:
<em>b</em>o<em>ghs</em>ó<em>me</em> ib. 394&ndash;5.</p>

<p>The other extreme of strict regularity in the number of syllables is
exhibited in another group of North English and Scottish compositions of
the fourteenth century, such as the <cite>Metrical Homilies</cite>, the <cite>Cursor
Mundi</cite>, Barbour’s <cite>Bruce</cite>, Wyntoun’s <cite>Chronykyl</cite>. The metrical licences
most frequent here are level<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_187" id="Pg_187" title="187"></a> stress, suppression of the anacrusis, and
the omission of unaccented syllables in the middle of the line, in the
<cite>Metrical Homilies</cite>. The rhythm is, however, as a rule, strictly iambic,
and the number of syllables eight or nine, according as the rhymes are
masculine or feminine.</p>

<p><a name="section129" id="section129"></a>
§ <b>129.</b> The contemporaneous literary productions of the Midlands and
South written in this metre generally observe a mean between the free
and the strict versification of the two northern groups.</p>

<p>These are inter alia <cite>The Story of Genesis and Exodus</cite>, <cite>The Owl and
Nightingale</cite>, <cite>The Lay of Havelok</cite>, <cite>Sir Orfeo</cite>, <cite>King Alisander</cite>,
several compositions of Chaucer’s,<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> as, for instance, <cite>The Book of
the Duchesse</cite>, <cite>The House of Fame</cite>, Gower’s <cite>Confessio Amantis</cite>, and
others. The last work, as well as <cite>The Owl and Nightingale</cite>, is written
in almost perfectly regular iambic verses, in which the syllables are
strictly counted. The other compositions more frequently admit the
familiar rhythmical licences and have a freer movement, but none to the
same extent as the <cite>Pater Noster</cite>. In artistic perfection this metre
presents itself to us in Chaucer, who was particularly skilful in
employing and varying the enjambement. A short specimen from his <cite>House
of Fame</cite> (ll. 151&ndash;74) will illustrate this:</p>

</div>

<p><a name="section130" id="section130"></a>
§ <b>130.</b> Four-foot verses often occur also in Middle English in
connexion with other metrical forms, especially with three-foot verses,
e.g. in the Septenary, which is resolved by the rhyme into two short
lines, and in the tail-rhyme stanza, or <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rime couée</em> (cf. §§ <a href="#section78">78</a>, <a href="#section79">79</a>).</p>

<p>In these combinations the structure of the metre remains essentially the
same, only there are in many poems more frequent instances of
suppression of the anacrusis, so that the metre assumes a variable
cadence, partly trochaic, partly iambic. At the end of the Middle
English period the four-foot verse was, along with other metrical forms,
employed by preference in the earlier dramatic productions, and was
skilfully used by Heywood, among others, in his interlude, <cite>The Four
P.’s</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="section131" id="section131"></a>
§ <b>131.</b> In he Modern English period this metre has also found great
favour, and we may, as in the case of other metres, distinguish between
a strict and a freer variety of it. The strict form was, and is, mostly
represented in lyric poetry, in verses rhyming in couplets or in cross
rhyme. The rhythm is generally in this case (since the separation
between iambic and trochaic verse-forms became definitely established)
strictly iambic, generally with monosyllabic rhymes.</p>

<p>A greater interest attaches to the freer variety of the metre, which is
to be regarded as a direct continuation of the Middle English four-foot
verse, inasmuch as it was practised by the poets of the first Modern
English period in imitation of earlier models, and has been further
cultivated by their successors down to the most recent times. The
characteristic feature in this treatment of the four-foot verse is the
frequent suppression of the anacrusis, by which it comes to resemble the
four-beat verse, along with which it is often used. But whilst the
latter generally has an iambic-anapaestic or trochaic-dactylic
structure, and is constantly divided by the caesura into two halves, the
Modern English four-foot verse of the freer type has, as a rule, an
alternately iambic and trochaic rhythm, with a rare occurrence of
caesuras. Shakespeare and other dramatists often employ this metre for
lyrical passages in<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_189" id="Pg_189" title="189"></a> their dramas. Of longer poems in the earlier period
Milton’s <cite>L’Allegro</cite> and <cite>Il Penseroso</cite> are conspicuous examples.</p>

<p>The following passage from <cite>L’Allegro</cite> (ll. 11&ndash;16) may serve as a
specimen:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">But cóme thou Góddess fáir and frée,</div>
    <div class="line">In héaven yclépt Euphrósyné,</div>
    <div class="line">Ánd by mén héart-easing Mírth,</div>
    <div class="line">Whom lóvely Vénus, át a bírth,</div>
    <div class="line">Wíth two síster Gráces móre,</div>
    <div class="line">To ívy-crównëd Bácchus bóre, <span class="normal">&amp;c.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The structure of the verse is essentially iambic, though the iambic
metre frequently, by suppression of the initial theses, as in the
thirteenth and fifteenth lines of this passage, falls into a trochaic
cadence. Pure trochaic verses, i.e. those that begin with an accented
syllable and end with an unaccented one, occur in these two poems, in
couplets, only once, <cite>L’Allegro</cite> (ll. 69&ndash;70):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Stráight mine éye hath cáught new pléasures,</div>
    <div class="line">Whíles the lándscape róund it méasures.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>With masculine endings such couplets are frequent, e.g. <cite>Il Penseroso</cite>,
67&ndash;8:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Tó behóld the wándering móon,</div>
    <div class="line">Ríding néar the híghest nóon;</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>further, ll. 75&ndash;6, 81&ndash;2, 141&ndash;2, &amp;c.</p>

<p>As a rule, pure iambic lines rhyme together, or an iambic with a line
that has a trochaic cadence, as, for instance, in the above specimen,
<cite>L’Allegro</cite>, 13&ndash;14 and 15&ndash;16.</p>

<p>Besides initial truncation there also occur here the other metrical
licences observed in iambic rhythm.</p>

<p><a name="section132" id="section132"></a>
§ <b>132.</b> Many sections of the narrative poems of Coleridge, Scott, and
Byron, e.g. the latter’s <cite>Siege of Corinth</cite>, are written in this form,
with which, in especially animated passages, four-beat verses often
alternate. Cf., for instance, the following passage, xvi, from the
last-named poem:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Stíll by the shóre Alp mútely músed,</div>
    <div class="line">And wóo’d the fréshness níght diffúsed.</div>
    <div class="line">There shrínks no ébb in that tídeless séa,</div>
    <div class="line">Which chángeless rólls etérnallý;</div>
    <div class="line">So that wíldest of wáves, in their ángriest móod,</div>
    <div class="line">Scarce bréak on the bóunds of the lánd for a róod;<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_190" id="Pg_190" title="190"></a></div>
    <div class="line">And the pówerless móon behólds them flów</div>
    <div class="line">Héedless if she cóme or gó:</div>
    <div class="line">Cálm or hígh, in máin or báy,</div>
    <div class="line">Ón their cóurse she háth no swáy.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Lines 5&ndash;7 can be at once recognized as four-stress verses by the
iambic-anapaestic rhythm, as well as by the strongly-marked caesura,
which, in the four-foot verses 4, and especially 8 and 10, is entirely
or almost entirely absent (cf. pp. <a href="#Pg_98">98&ndash;9</a>); and both metrical forms, the
calmer four-foot verse and the more animated four-stress metre, are in
harmonious agreement with the tone of this passage.</p>

<p>Four-foot lines, forming component parts of metrically heterogeneous
types of stanzas, such, for instance, as the tail-rhyme stave, are
generally more regularly constructed than in the Middle English period.</p>

<p><a name="section133" id="section133"></a>
§ <b>133.</b> Among the metrical forms which took their rise from the
four-foot line, the most noteworthy are the two-foot and the one-foot
verse, the former the result of halving the four-foot verse, the latter
of dividing the two-foot verse, as a rule, by means of the rhyme. These
verse-forms only seldom occur in the Middle English period, as a rule in
anisometrical stanzas in connexion with verses of greater length. Thus,
in the poem in Wright’s <cite>Specimens of Lyric Poetry</cite>, p. 38, composed in
the entwined tail-rhyme stanza, the short lines have two accents:
<em>wiþóute stríf: y wýte, a wýf</em> 10&ndash;12; <em>in tóune tréwe: while ý may
gléwe</em> 4&ndash;6. The eighteen-lined enlarged tail-rhyme stave of the ballad,
<cite>The Nut-brown Maid</cite> (Percy’s <cite>Reliques</cite>, iii. 6), also consists of two-
and three-foot lines; in this case the two-foot lines may be conceived
as the result of halving the first hemistich of the septenary line.</p>

<p>In Modern English two-foot lines are also rare and are chiefly found in
anisometrical stanzas. They do occur, however, here and there in
isometrical poems, either written in couplets or in stanzas of lines
rhyming alternately; as, for instance, in Drayton, <cite>An Amouret
Anacreontic</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Most góod, most fáir,</div>
    <div class="line">Or thíngs as ráre</div>
    <div class="line">To cáll you’s lóst;</div>
    <div class="line">For áll the cóst</div>
    <div class="line">Wórds can bestów,</div>
    <div class="line">Só póorly shów<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_191" id="Pg_191" title="191"></a></div>
    <div class="line">Upón your práise</div>
    <div class="line">That áll the wáys</div>
    <div class="line">Sénse hath, come shórt, <span class="normal">&amp;c.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The commonest rhythmical licences are inversion of accent and initial
truncation. In stanzas verses of this sort occur, for the most part it
seems, with the rhyme-order <em>a b c b</em>, for instance in Burns, <cite>The Cats
like Kitchen</cite>, and Moore, <cite>When Love is Kind</cite>, so that these verses
might be regarded as four-foot lines rhyming in couplets.</p>

<p><a name="section134" id="section134"></a>
§ <b>134.</b> One-foot lines, both with single and with double ending,
likewise occur in Middle English only as component parts of
anisometrical stanzas, as a rule as <em>bob</em>-verses in what are called
<em>bob-wheel</em> staves; as, for instance, in a poem in Wright’s <cite>Songs and
Carols</cite> (Percy Society, 1847), the line <em>With áye</em> rhyming with the
three-foot line <em>Aye, áye, I dár well sáy</em>; in the <cite>Towneley Mysteries</cite>,
the verse <em>Alás</em> rhyming with <em>A góod máster he wás</em>; in an <cite>Easter
Carol</cite> (Morris, <cite>An Old Engl. Miscellany</cite>, pp. 197&ndash;9), the line <em>So
strónge</em> rhyming with <em>Jóye hím wit sónge</em>, or <em>In lónde</em> and <em>of hónde</em>
rhyming with <em>Al with jóye þat is fúnde</em>.</p>

<p>Metrical licences can naturally only seldom occur in such short lines.</p>

<p>One-foot iambic lines occur also in the Modern English period almost
exclusively in anisometrical stanzas. A little poem entitled <cite>Upon his
Departure hence</cite>, in Herrick’s <cite>Hesperides</cite>, may be quoted as a
curiosity, as it is written in continuous one-foot lines of this kind,
rhyming in triplets:</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="subtitle">THE SEPTENARY, THE ALEXANDRINE, AND THE
  THREE-FOOT LINE</span></h3>

<p><a name="section135" id="section135"></a>
§ <b>135. The Septenary</b> is a favourite Middle English metre, going back
to a Mediaeval Latin model. It cannot, however, be definitely determined
whether this is to be found in the (accentual) catalectic iambic
tetrameter, an example of which is preserved, among other instances, in
the <cite>Planctus Bonaventurae</cite> (1221&ndash;74) printed by Mone in his <cite>Latin
Hymns of the Middle Ages</cite>, which begins as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">O crux, frutex salvificus, | vivo fonte rigatus,</div>
    <div class="line">Quem flos exornat fulgidus, | fructus fecundat gratus,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>or possibly in another Latin metre which was a far greater favourite
with the Anglo-Norman Latin poets. This is the (accentual)
brachycatalectic trochaic tetrameter, which frequently occurs, among
other instances, in the poems ascribed to Walter Map, e.g. in the still
popular verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Mihi est propositum | in taberna mori,</div>
    <div class="line">Vinum sit appositum | morientis ori.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The result of an attempt to adopt this metre in Middle English might, on
account of the preference of the language for iambic rhythm, very
naturally be to transform it into the iambic catalectic tetrameter by
the frequent addition of an unaccented opening syllable at the beginning
of each half-line. Probably the latter verse-form was the model, as may
be seen from Leigh Hunt’s Modern English translation of the Latin
drinking-song just <span class="locked">quoted.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover, many mediaeval Latin verses also have a wavering rhythm
resulting in a form at times characterized by level stress, e.g.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Fortunae rota volvitur; | descendo minoratus,</div>
    <div class="line">Alter in altum tollitur | nimis exaltatus.</div>
    <div class="line">Rex sedet in vertice, | caveat ruinam,</div>
    <div class="line">Nam sub axe legimus | ‘Hecubam’ reginam.</div>
       <div class="attribution">Carmina Burana, lxxvii.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_193" id="Pg_193" title="193"></a></p>

<p><a name="section136" id="section136"></a>
§ <b>136.</b> These verses correspond pretty exactly, in their metrical
structure, to the opening lines of the <cite>Moral Ode</cite>, which, as far as is
known, is the earliest Middle English poem in septenary lines, and dates
from the twelfth century:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Íc am élder þánne ic wés, | a wíntre and éc a lóre;</div>
    <div class="line">ic éaldi móre þánne ic déde: | mi wít oȝhte tó bi móre.</div>
    <div class="line">Wel lónge ic hábbe chíld ibíen | on wórde ánd on déde;</div>
    <div class="line">þéȝh ic bí on wíntren éald, | to ȝíung ic ám on réde.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The other common licences of even-beat metre which affect the rhythm of
the line, the metrical value of syllables, and the word-accent, also
occur in the <cite>Moral Ode</cite>. Suppression of the anacrusis is very often met
with; it occurs, for instance, in the first hemistich, in lines 1 and 4
above; in the second hemistich, <em>ér ic hít iwíste</em> l. 17, in both, <em>þó
þet hábbeð wél idón | éfter híre míhte</em>, l. 175; so that a pure iambic
couplet seldom occurs, although the iambic rhythm is, on the whole,
predominant. The omission of unaccented syllables in the middle of the
line is also often found (although many verses of this kind probably
require emendation), as <em>Ne léve nó mán to múchel</em> 24; also in the
second hemistich, as <em>and wól éche dede</em> 88. Transpositions of the
accent are quite usual at the beginning of the first as well as of the
second hemistich: <em>Elde me ís bestólen ón</em> 17; <em>síððen ic spéke cúðe</em> 9.
Level stress is also not absent: <em>For bétere is án elmésse bifóre</em> 28.
We often meet with elision, apocope, syncope, slurring of syllables, and
the use of a disyllabic thesis both at the beginning of the line and in
other positions: <em>þo þet wél ne dóeþ þe wíle he múȝe</em> 19; <em>nís hit
búte gámen and glíe</em> 188. A noteworthy indication of want of skill in
the handling of the Septenary in this first attempt is the frequent
occurrence of a superfluous syllable at the close of the first
hemistich, which should only admit of an acatalectic ending, e.g.: <em>Hé
scal cúme on úuele stéde | búte him Gód beo mílde</em> 26; <em>Eíðer to lútel
ánd to múchel | scal þúnchen éft hem báthe</em> 62, &amp;c. The end of the
second hemistich, on the other hand, in accordance with the structure of
the metre, is in this poem always catalectic.</p>

<p><a name="section137" id="section137"></a>
§ <b>137.</b> The irregularity of the structure of the Septenary rhyming line
of the <cite>Moral Ode</cite> stands in marked contrast with the regularity of the
rhymeless Septenary verse of the <cite>Ormulum</cite>. The first hemistich here is
always acatalectic, the second catalectic, and the whole line has never
more nor less than fifteen syllables.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_194" id="Pg_194" title="194"></a></p>

<p>Hence the only metrical licences that occur here are elision, syncope,
and apocope of the unaccented <em>e</em> of some inflexional endings, and the
very frequent admission of level stress in disyllabic and polysyllabic
words, which are to be found in all places in the line:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Icc þátt tiss Énnglissh háfe sétt | <span class="normal">E</span>nnglísshe ménn to láre,</div>
    <div class="line">Icc wáss þær þǽr I crísstnedd wáss | <span class="normal">O</span>rrmín bi náme némmnedd,</div>
    <div class="line">Annd ícc <span class="normal">O</span>rrmín full ínnwarrdlíȝ | wiþþ múð annd éc wiþþ
        hérrte.</div>
      <div class="attribution">Dedic. 322&ndash;7.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In all such cases, in the versification of Orm, whose practice is to
count the syllables, there can only be a question of level stress, not
of inversion of accent. <em>Ennglisshe</em> at the beginning of the second
hemistich of the above line, 322, is no more an example of inversion of
rhythm than in the hemistich <em>Icc háfe wénnd inntill <span class="normal">E</span>nnglíssh</em> l. 13</p>

<p><a name="section138" id="section138"></a>
§ <b>138.</b> After the <cite>Moral Ode</cite> and the <cite>Ormulum</cite> the Septenary often
occurs in combination with other metres, especially the Alexandrine, of
which we shall speak later on.</p>

<p>In some works of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the Septenary
was, however, employed in a fairly unmixed form, as, for instance, in
the <cite>Lives of Saints</cite>, ed. Furnivall, 1862, the <cite>Fragment of Popular
Science</cite>, ed. Wright in <cite>Popular Treatises on Science</cite>, London, 1841,
and several others.</p>

<p>The most important deviation from the Septenary of Orm and of the <cite>Moral
Ode</cite> is the frequent occurrence of long lines with a masculine instead
of the usual feminine ending. Both forms are to be found in the opening
lines of the <cite>Fragment of Popular Science</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">The ríȝte pút of hélle ís | amídde the úrþe wiþínne,</div>
    <div class="line">Oure Lóverd þát al mákede iwís, | quéinte ís of gýnne,</div>
    <div class="line">Héuene and úrþe ymákede iwís, | and síþþe alle þíng þat ís,</div>
    <div class="line">Úrpe is a lútel húrfte | aȝén héuene iwís.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It may fairly be assumed that the structure of the Alexandrine (which,
according to French models, might have either a masculine or a feminine
ending) may have greatly furthered the intrusion of monosyllabic feet
into the Septenary verse, although the gradual decay of the final
inflexions may likewise have contributed to this end. For the rest, all
the rhythmic licences of the Septenary occurring in the <cite>Moral Ode</cite> are
also to be met with here; as, for instance, the suppression of the
anacrusis in the first hemistich of l. 4 of the passage quoted, and in
the second<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_195" id="Pg_195" title="195"></a> of l. 2, and the omission of the unaccented syllable in the
second hemistich of the fourth line, the inversion of accent and
disyllabic thesis in the first hemistich of the third line, and other
licences, such as the anapaestic beginning of the line, &amp;c., in other
places in these poems (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, i, p. 246)</p>

<p><a name="section139" id="section139"></a>
§ <b>139.</b> In lyrical poems of this time and in later popular ballad poetry
the Septenary is employed in another manner, namely, in four-lined
stanzas of four- and three-foot verse, rhyming crosswise, each of which
must be looked on as consisting of pairs of Septenaries with middle
rhyme inserted (interlaced rhyme), as is clearly shown by the Latin
models of these metrical forms quoted above (p. <a href="#Pg_192">192</a>). Latin and English
lines are thus found connected, so as to form a stanza, in a poem of the
fifteenth century:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Fréeres, fréeres, wó ȝe bé!</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Mínistrí malórum,</div>
    <div class="line">For mány a mánnes sóule bringe ȝé</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Ad póenas ínfernórum.
  </div>
</div>
<div class="attribution">Political Poems, ii. 249.</div>

<p>In many lyrical poems of the older period some stanzas rhyme in long
lines, others rhyme in short lines, which shows the gradual genesis of
the short-lined metre, rhyming throughout. Thus, in the poem in Wright’s
<cite>Spec. of Lyr. P.</cite>, p. 90, the opening verses of the first stanza rhyme
in long lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">My déþ y lóue, my lýf ich háte, | fór a léuedy shéne,</div>
    <div class="line">Héo is bríht so daíes líht, | þat ís on mé wel séne,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>whereas those of the second rhyme in short lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Sórewe and sýke and dréri mód | býndeþ mé so fáste,</div>
    <div class="line">Þát y wéne to wálke wód, | ȝef hít me léngore láste.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Instances of this kind are frequent; but the four lines of the single
stanzas are never completely rhymed throughout as short-lines, as, for
instance, is the case in the opening parts or ‘frontes’ of the stanzas
of the poems in Wright’s <cite>Spec. of Lyr. P.</cite>, pp. 27 and 83, the lines of
which are far more regularly constructed. The rhymes are in these
compositions still generally disyllabic.</p>

<p>The metrical structure of the old ballads <cite>The Battle of Otterborn</cite> and
<cite>Chevy Chase</cite> is similar to that of the poem just quoted. In those
ballads some original long lines are provided with middle rhyme, others
not, so that the stanzas partly rhyme<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_196" id="Pg_196" title="196"></a> according to the formula <em>a b c
b</em>, partly according to the formula <em>a b a b</em>. The versification is,
moreover, very uneven, and the endings are, as a rule, if not without
exception, masculine:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Sir Hárry Pérssy cam to the wálles,</div>
    <div class="line">The Skóttish óste for to sé;</div>
    <div class="line">And sáyd, and thou hast brént Northómberlónd,</div>
    <div class="line">Full sóre it réwyth mé.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The ballads of the end of the Middle English period are generally
composed in far more regular lines or stanzas. The feminine endings of
the Septenary are, however, as a rule replaced by masculine endings,
whether the lines rhyme crosswise or only in the three-foot verses. Cf.
the ballad, <cite>The Lady’s Fall</cite> (Ritson, ii. 110), which, however, was
probably composed as late as the Modern English period:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Mark wéll my héavy dóleful tále,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">You lóyal lóvers áll,</div>
    <div class="line">And héedfullý béar in your bréast</div>
    <div class="line indent2">A gállant lády’s fáll.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a name="section140" id="section140"></a>
§ <b>140.</b> In Modern English the Septenary has been extensively used, both
in long and in short rhyming lines. One special variety of it,
consisting of stanzas of four lines, alternately of eight and six
syllables (always with masculine ending), is designated in hymn-books by
the name of Common Metre.</p>

<p>In the long-lined form this metre occurs at the beginning of this period
in poems of some length, as, for instance, in William Warner’s <cite>Albion’s
England</cite>, and in Chapman’s translation of the <cite>Iliad</cite>. Here, too, the
ending of the line is almost without exception masculine, and the
rhythm, on the whole, pretty regular, although this regularity,
especially in Chapman, is, in accordance with the contemporary practice,
only attained by alternate full pronunciation and slurring of the same
syllables (Romanic <em>-ion</em>, <em>-ious</em>, &amp;c., and Germanic <em>-ed</em>, &amp;c.) and by
inversion of accent. The caesura is always masculine at the end of the
first hemistich, but masculine or feminine minor caesuras are often met
with after the second or in the third foot, sometimes also after the
first or in the second:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Occásioned thús: | Chrýses the príest || cáme to the fléet to búy. <span class="attrib">i. 11.</span></div>
    <div class="line">To plágue the ármy, | ánd to déath || by tróops the sóldiers wént.<span class="attrib">ib. 10.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_197" id="Pg_197" title="197"></a></p>

<p>Secondary caesuras also occur, though less frequently, in other places
in the line, particularly in the second hemistich:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">But íf thou wílt be sáfe begóne. || This sáid, | the séa-beat
        shóre. <span class="attrib">ib. 32.</span></div>
    <div class="line">All mén in óne aróse and sáid: || Atrídes, | nów I sée.
        <span class="attrib">ib. 54.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>These last examples suffice to show the rich variety of the caesura,
which may be referred perhaps to the influence of blank verse, in the
management of which Chapman displays great skill, and to the frequent
use which he makes of the enjambement. Rhyme-breaking also sometimes
occurs in his verse. Occasionally three consecutive lines rhyme
together, as in W. Warner, whose versification is otherwise extremely
regular, similar to that of lyrical poetry. In this branch of poetry the
Septenary, with the simple rhyme-order <em>a b c b</em> and especially with the
more artistic form <em>a b a b</em>, has continued to be very popular from the
time of Wyatt down to the present day. The three-foot line has naturally
in most instances a masculine ending, but lines also occasionally occur
with feminine rhyme. In many poems the feminine rhyme is, moreover,
regularly employed in this metre; as, for instance, in Burns’s <cite>To John
Taylor</cite> (p. 158):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">With Pégasús upón a dáy,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Apóllo wéary flýing,</div>
    <div class="line">Through frósty hílls the jóurney láy,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">On fóot the wáy was plýing.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In ballad poetry, on the other hand, the Septenary metre tends to assume
a somewhat freer construction, similar to, though not so capricious as
that in the old ballads edited by Percy. A well-known example is offered
by Coleridge’s <cite>Rime of the Ancient Mariner</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">It ís an áncient Márinér, | And he stoppeth óne of thrée:</div>
    <div class="line">‘By thy lóng grey béard and glíttering éye, | Now whérefore stópp’st thou mé?’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Two unaccented opening syllables and two unaccented syllables in the
middle of the line are, in particular, often met with.</p>

<p><a name="section141" id="section141"></a>
§ <b>141. The Septenary in combination with other metres.</b> After its
occurrence in the <cite>Moral Ode</cite> and the <cite>Ormulum</cite> the Septenary, as we
have seen, appears at first very<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_198" id="Pg_198" title="198"></a> seldom by itself, but generally in
connexion with other metres, especially the old long line in its freer
development, the four-foot metre (though more rarely), and,
particularly, the Alexandrine.</p>

<p>The Middle English Alexandrine was constructed on the model of the Old
French Alexandrine&mdash;except for the use of Teutonic licences in even-beat
rhythm&mdash;and it thus possessed four different types, which the following
examples from <cite>On god Ureison of ure Lefdi</cite><a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> may serve to
illustrate. We give the corresponding Old French metrical types from the
<cite>Roman d’Alixandre</cite> (Bartsch, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chrestomathie de l’ancien français</cite>, p.
175).</p>

<p><em>a.</em> Masculine caesura with masculine line-ending:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Alexandrines of this sort, particularly of the last type, are
found in a group of poems of the close of the twelfth, or beginning
of the thirteenth century, intermingled with Septenaries,
and also, though more seldom, combined with four-beat alliterative
rhyming long lines and with four-foot verses. Such poems
are <cite>On god Ureison of ure Lefdi</cite> (quoted above), <cite>A lutel soth
sermon</cite> (<cite>Old English Miscellany</cite>, ed. R. Morris, pp. 186 ff.),
and <cite>A Bestiary</cite> (ib. pp. 1&ndash;25).</p>

<p>The following lines from <cite>A lutel soth sermon</cite> may serve to illustrate
this mixture:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>Here we have Septenaries (ll. 1, 4, 7) and Alexandrines (ll. 2, 3, 5, 6,
8) intermixed in ll. 1&ndash;8, eight-foot long lines resolved by means of
<em>sectional rhyme</em> into four-foot lines in ll. 9&ndash;12, and four-beat
rhyming alliterative long lines of the freer type in ll. 13&ndash;16. The easy
intermixture of metres may be explained by the fact that in all these
different long-lined metrical forms four <em>principal stresses</em> are
prominent amid the rest, as we have indicated by accents (´).</p>

<p><a name="section142" id="section142"></a>
§ <b>142.</b> In the <cite>Bestiary</cite> this mixture of metrical forms has assumed
still greater proportions, inasmuch as alongside of the long-lined
rhyming Septenaries and alliterative long lines there are found also
Layamon’s short-lined rhyming verses and Septenary lines resolved into
short verses by middle rhyme.</p>

<p>The following passages may more closely illustrate the metrical
construction of this poem; in the first place, ll. 384&ndash;97:</p>

<p>Here we have unmistakable long lines of the freer type.</p>

<p>In other passages the alliterative long lines pass into Septenaries, as,
for instance, ll. 273&ndash;98:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>In a third instance (ll. 628&ndash;35) Septenary and four-foot lines run into
one another:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Hú he résteð him ðis dér,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>In many passages in the poem one or other of these different types of
verse occurs unmixed with others. Thus we have short couplets in the
section 444&ndash;5; in ll. 1&ndash;39 alliterative rhymeless verse, occasionally of
marked archaic construction, concluding with a hemistich (39) which
rhymes with the preceding hemistich so as to form a transition to the
following section (ll. 40&ndash;52), which again consists of four-foot and
Septenary verses. These are followed by a section (ll. 53&ndash;87) in which
four-foot and three-foot lines (that is to say, Alexandrines) rhyming in
couplets are blended; and this is succeeded by a further section (ll.
88&ndash;119) mostly consisting of Septenaries resolved by the rhyme into
short lines. (Cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, i, §§ 79&ndash;84.)</p>

<p>Hence we may say that the poet, in accordance with his Latin model
(likewise composed in various metres), has purposely made use of these
different metrical forms, and that the assertion made by Trautmann and
others,<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> that the Septenary of the <cite>Ormulum</cite> and the <cite>Moral Ode</cite>,
which is contemporary with Layamon, represents the final result of the
development of<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_201" id="Pg_201" title="201"></a> Layamon’s verse (the freer alliterative long line), must
be erroneous.</p>

<p><a name="section143" id="section143"></a>
§ <b>143.</b> In <cite>On god Ureison of ure Lefdi</cite>, on the other hand, the
alliterative long lines play only an insignificant part, a part which is
confined to an occasional use of a two-beat rhythm in the hemistichs and
the frequent introduction of alliteration. Septenaries and Alexandrines
here interchange <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</em>.</p>

<p>The following short passage (ll. 23&ndash;34) will suffice to illustrate these
combinations of metres:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>

<p>Lines 26 and 34, perhaps also 25 and 30, are Septenaries, l. 28 is the
only line of the poem which contains two beats in both hemistichs
(hemistichs of this sort are further found in the first hemistich of ll.
3, 12, 44, 72, 77, and in the second of ll. 30, 45, 46, 52, and 70); the
remaining lines of this passage are most naturally scanned as
Alexandrines.</p>

<p><a name="section144" id="section144"></a>
§ <b>144.</b> Now, this unsystematic combination of Alexandrines
and Septenaries is a metre which was especially in vogue in the
Middle English period. In this metrical form two religious
poems, <cite>The Passion of our Lord</cite> and <cite>The Woman of Samaria</cite>
(Morris, <cite>Old English Miscellany</cite>), were composed so early as
the beginning of the thirteenth century. From the first we
quote ll. 21&ndash;4:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
     <div class="line">Léuedi þu bére þat béste chíld, | þat éuer wés ibóre;</div>
     <div class="line">Of þe he mákede his móder, | vor hé þe hédde ycóre.</div>
     <div class="line">Ádam ánd his ófsprung | ál hit wére furlóre,</div>
     <div class="line">Ýf þi súne nére, | ibléssed þu béo þervóre.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Many lines of these poems may be scanned in both ways;
in the third line of the preceding extract, for instance, we may<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_202" id="Pg_202" title="202"></a>
either take the second syllable of the word <em>ofsprung</em>, in the manner
of the usual even-beat rhythm, to form a thesis (in this case
hypermetrical, yielding an epic caesura), or we may regard it as
forming, according to ancient Germanic usage, a fourth arsis of
the hemistich, which would then belong to a Septenary. At any
rate, this scansion would, in this case, be quite admissible, as
indeed the other licences of even-beat rhythm all occur here.</p>

<p>It is in this metre that the South English Legends of Saints (<cite>Ms.
Harleian</cite> 2277) and other poems in the same MS., as the <cite>Fragment on
Popular Science</cite> (fourteenth century), are written. The same holds good
for Robert of Gloucester’s Rhyming Chronicle (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, i, §§ 113,
114). Mätzner (in his <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Altengl. Sprachproben</cite>, p. 155), and Ten Brink
(<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Literaturgeschichte</cite>, i, pp. 334, 345) concur in this opinion, while
Trautmann (in <cite>Anglia</cite>, v, Anz., pp. 123&ndash;5), on a theory of metrical
accentuation which we hold to be untenable, pronounces the verses to be
Septenaries.</p>

<p>The following passage (Mätzner, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Altengl. Sprachproben</cite>, i, p. 155) may
serve to illustrate the versification of Robert of Gloucester:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

§ <b>145.</b> At the end of the thirteenth century the Septenary and
Alexandrine were, however, relegated to a subordinate position by the
new fashionable five-foot iambic verse. But we soon meet them again in
popular works of another kind, viz. in the Miracle Plays, especially in
some plays of the <cite>Towneley Collection</cite>, like the <cite>Conspiratio et
Capcio</cite> (p. 182), and actually employed quite in the arbitrary sequence
hitherto observed, Alexandrine sometimes rhyming with Alexandrine,
Septenary with Septenary, but, more frequently, Alexandrine with
Septenary. A passage from the Towneley Mysteries may make this clear:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Now háve ye hárt what Í have sáyde, | I gó and cóm agáyn,</div>

    <div class="line">Many thýnges so sóyn | at thís tyme spéak with yóu.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This metre is also employed in many Moral Plays with a similar liberty
in the succession of the two metrical forms.</p>

<p>But we may often observe in these works, as, for instance, in Redford’s
<cite>Marriage of Wit and Science</cite> (Dodsley, ii, p. 325 sq.), that
Alexandrines and Septenaries are used interchangeably, though not
according to any fixed plan, so that sometimes the Septenary and
sometimes the Alexandrine precedes in the couplet, as, for instance, in
the last four lines of the following passage (Dodsley, ii, p. 386):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

<p><a name="section146" id="section146"></a>
§ <b>146.</b> In other passages in this drama, e.g. in the speech of <em>Wit</em>,
p. 359, this combination (Alexandrine with Septenary following) occurs
in a sequence of some length. It existed, however, before Redford’s
time, as a favourite form of stave, in lyrical as well as in narrative
poetry, and was well known to the first Tudor English prosodists under
the name of <cite>The Poulter’s Measure</cite><span class="locked">.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The opening lines of Surrey’s <cite>Complaint of a dying Lover</cite> (p. 24)
present an example of its cadence:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">In wínter’s just retúrn, | when Bóreas gán his réign,</div>
    <div class="line">And évery trée unclóthed fást, | as Náture táught them pláin:</div>

    <div class="line">I híed me fást, it sát me ón, | my shéep for tó unfóld.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Brooke’s narrative poem <em>Romeus and Juliet</em>, utilized by Shakespeare for
his drama of the same name, is in this metre. Probably the strict iambic
cadence and the fixed position of the caesura<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_204" id="Pg_204" title="204"></a> caused this metre to
appear especially adapted for cultured poetry, at a time when rising and
falling rhythms were first sharply distinguished. It was, however, not
long popular, though isolated examples are found in modern poets, as,
for instance, Cowper and Watts. Thackeray uses it for comic poems, for
which it appears especially suitable, sometimes using the two kinds of
verse promiscuously, as Dean Swift had done before him, and sometimes
employing the Alexandrine and Septenary in regular alternation.</p>

<p><a name="section147" id="section147"></a>
§ <b>147. The Alexandrine</b> runs more smoothly than the Septenary. The
Middle English Alexandrine is a six-foot iambic line with a caesura
after the third foot. This caesura, like the end of the line, may be
either masculine or feminine.</p>

<p>This metre was probably employed for the first time in Robert Mannyng’s
translation of Peter Langtoft’s rhythmical Chronicle, partly composed in
French Alexandrines. The four metrical types of the model mentioned
above (p. <a href="#Pg_198">198</a>) naturally also make their appearance here.</p>

<div class="lines-container">

        <div class="attribution">p. 21, ll. 7&ndash;8.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The Germanic licences incidental to even-beat rhythm are strikingly
perceptible throughout.</p>

<p>In the first line we have to note in both hemistichs suppression of the
anacrusis, in the second either the omission of an unaccented syllable
or lengthening of a word (<em>Ing</em>(<em>e</em>)<em>lond</em>). The second line has a regular
structure: in the third the suppression of the anacrusis is to be noted
and the absence of an unaccented syllable in the second hemistich. The
last line has the regular number of syllables, but double inversion of
accent in the first hemistich. A disyllabic thesis at the beginning or
in the middle of the line also frequently occurs.</p>

<div class="lines-container">

</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_205" id="Pg_205" title="205"></a></p>

<p>There is less freedom of structure in the Alexandrine as used in the
lyrical poems of this period, in which, however, the verse is generally
resolved by middle rhyme into short lines, as may be seen from the
examples in § <a href="#section150">150</a>.</p>

<p><a name="section148" id="section148"></a>
§ <b>148.</b> The structure of the Alexandrine is, on the other hand,
extremely irregular in the late Middle English Mysteries and the Early
English Moral Plays, where, so far as we have observed, it is not
employed in any piece as the exclusive metre, but mostly occurs either
as the first member of the above-mentioned <cite>Poulter’s Measure</cite>, and
occasionally in uninterrupted sequence in speeches of considerable
length. We cannot therefore always say with certainty whether we have in
many passages of <cite>Jacob and Esau</cite> (Dodsley’s <cite>Old Plays</cite>, ed. Hazlitt,
vol. ii, pp. 185 ff.) to deal with four-beat lines or with unpolished
Alexandrines (cf. Act <span class="fakesc">II</span>, Sc. i). In other pieces, on the other hand,
the Alexandrine, where it appears in passages of some length, is pretty
regularly constructed, as, for instance, in Redford’s <cite>Marriage of Wit
and Science</cite> (Dodsley, ii, pp. 325 ff.), e.g. in Act <span class="fakesc">II.</span> Sc. ii (pp.
340&ndash;1):</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The caesura and close of the line are in this passage, which comprises
eighteen lines, monosyllabic throughout.</p>

<p><a name="section149" id="section149"></a>
§ <b>149.</b> In Modern English the Alexandrine is also found in a long-lined
rhyming form, as, for instance, in the sixteenth century in certain
poems by Sidney, but notably in Drayton’s <cite>Polyolbion</cite>.</p>

<p>The Modern English Alexandrine is particularly distinguished from the
Middle English variety by the fact that the four types of the Middle
English Alexandrine are reduced to one, the caesura being regularly
masculine and the close of the line nearly always so; further by the
very scanty employment of the Teutonic rhythmical licences; cf. the
opening lines of the <cite>Polyolbion</cite> (<cite>Poets</cite>, iii. pp. 239 ff.):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Of Álbion’s glórious ísle | the wónders whílst I wríte,</div>

    <div class="line">The cálms too míldly smáll, | nor wínds too róughly gréat, <span class="normal">&amp;c.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_206" id="Pg_206" title="206"></a></p>

<p>Minor caesuras seldom occur, and generally in the second hemistich, as,
e.g., minor lyric caesuras after the first foot:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Wise génius, | bý thy hélp || that só I máy descrý.</div>
    <div class="attribution">240 a;</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>or masculine caesura after the second foot:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Ye sácred bárds | that to || your hárps’ melódious stríngs.</div>
    <div class="attribution">ib.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Enjambement is only sporadically met with; breaking of the rhyme still
more seldom.</p>

<p>Less significance is to be attached to the fact that Brysket, in a poem
on Sidney’s death, entitled <cite>The Mourning Muse of Thestylis</cite> (printed
with Spenser’s works, Globe edition, p. 563), makes Alexandrines rhyme
together, not in couplets, but in an arbitrary order; further, that
Surrey and Blennerhasset occasionally composed in similarly constructed
rhymeless Alexandrines (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, p. 83).</p>

<p>Of greater importance is the structure of the Alexandrine when used as
the concluding line of the Spenserian stanza and of its imitations.</p>

<p>It is here noteworthy that the lyric caesura, unusual in Middle English,
often occurs in Spenser after the first hemistich:</p>

 <div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">That súch a cúrsed créature || líves so lóng a spáce.</div>
    <div class="attribution">F. Q. <span class="fakesc">I.</span> i. 31;</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>as well as in connexion with minor caesuras:</p>

 <div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Upón his fóe, | a Drágon, || hórriblé and stéarne.
          <span class="attrib">ib. <span class="fakesc">I.</span> i. 3.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The closing line of the Spenserian stanza is similarly handled by other
poets, such as Thomson, Scott, Wordsworth, while poets like Pope, Byron,
Shelley, and others admit only masculine caesuras after the third foot.
By itself the Alexandrine has not often been employed in Modern English.</p>

<p>Connected in couplets it occurs in the nineteenth century in
Wordsworth’s verse, e.g. in <cite>The Pet Lamb</cite> (ii. 149), and is in this use
as well as in the Spenserian stanza treated by this poet with greater
freedom than by others, two opening and medial disyllabic theses as well
as suppression of anacrusis, being frequently admitted, while on the
other hand the caesura and close of the verse are always monosyllabic.</p>

<p><a name="section150" id="section150"></a>
§ <b>150. The three-foot line</b> has its origin theoretically, and as a
rule also actually, in a halving of the Alexandrine, and this is
effected less frequently by the use of leonine than by cross rhyme.</p>

<p>Two Alexandrine long lines are, for instance, frequently<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_207" id="Pg_207" title="207"></a> resolved in
this metrical type into four three-foot short lines with crossed rhymes,
as, e.g., in Robert Mannyng’s <cite>Chronicle</cite>, from p. 69 of Hearne’s
edition onwards.</p>

<p>From our previous description of the four types of the Middle English
Alexandrine, determined by the caesura and the close of the verse, it is
clear that the short verses resulting from them may rhyme either with
masculine or feminine endings, as, e.g., on p. 78, ll. 1, 2:</p>

<p>In accordance with the general character of the metre the verses in this
Chronicle are, even when rhyming as short lines, printed as long lines,
especially as this order of rhymes is not consistently observed in all
places in which they occur.</p>

<p>In lyrical poetry this metre is naturally chiefly found arranged in
short lines, as in the following examples:</p>

<p>With another order of rhymes these verses are also met
with in tail-rhyme stanzas of different kinds, as, for instance,
in Wright’s <cite>Spec. of L. P.</cite>, p. 41:</p>

<div class="column-container">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>As a rule, the verses in such lyrical compositions intended to be sung
are more regularly constructed than in those of narrative poetry, where
the usual Germanic metrical licences occur more frequently.</p>

<p>In Modern English the three-foot verse has remained a favourite, chiefly
in lyrical poetry, and occurs there as well with monosyllabic as with
disyllabic rhymes, which may either follow one another or be crossed,
e.g.:</p>

<div class="column-container">

  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_208" id="Pg_208" title="208"></a></p>

<p>We seldom find three-foot verses with disyllabic rhymes throughout.
There is, on the other hand, in lyrical poetry a predilection for
stanzas in which disyllabic rhymes alternate with monosyllabic, as, for
instance, in Sheffield, <cite>On the Loss of an only Son</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>

<p>Rhythmical licences, such as suppression of the anacrusis, seldom occur
in such short lines. The species of licence that is most frequent
appears to be inversion of accent.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER  XI<br />
<span class="subtitle">THE RHYMED FIVE-FOOT VERSE</span></h3>

<p><a name="section151" id="section151"></a>
§ <b>151.</b> Among all English metres the five-foot verse may be said to be
the metre which has been employed in the greatest number of poems, and
in those of highest merit.</p>

<p>Two forms can be distinguished, namely, the rhymed and the rhymeless
five-foot verse (the latter being known as <em>blank verse</em>), which are of
equal importance, though not of equal antiquity.</p>

<p>The rhymed five-foot verse was known in English poetry as far back as
the second half of the thirteenth century, and has been a favourite
metre from Chaucer’s first poetic attempts onward to the present, whilst
the blank verse was first introduced into English literature about the
year 1540 by the Earl of Surrey (1518&ndash;47), and has been frequently
employed ever since that time. The rhymed five-foot verse was, and has
continued to be, mainly preferred for lyrical and epic, the blank verse
for dramatic poetry. The latter, however, has been employed e.g. by
Milton, and after him by Thomson and many others for the epic and allied
species of poetry; while rhymed five-foot verse was used during a
certain period for dramatic poetry, e.g. by Davenant and Dryden, but by
the latter only for a short time.</p>

<p><b>Rhymed five-accent verse</b> occurs in Middle English both in poems
composed in stanza form and (since Chaucer’s <cite>Legend of Good Women</cite>, c.
1386) in couplets.</p>

<p>This metre, apart from differences in the length of the line and in
number of accents, is by no means to be looked upon as different from
the remaining even-stressed metres of that time. For, like the Middle
English four-foot verse and the Alexandrine, it derives its origin from
a French source, its prototype being the French decasyllabic verse. This
is a metre with rising rhythm, in which the caesura generally comes
after the fourth syllable, as e.g. in the line:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ja mais n’iert tels | com fut as anceisors.</span> <span class="attrib">Saint Alexis, l. 5.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_210" id="Pg_210" title="210"></a></p>

<p>To this verse the following line of Chaucer’s corresponds
exactly in point of structure:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">A kníght ther wás, | and thát a wórthy mán.</div>
       <div class="attribution">Cant. Tales, Prol. 43</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a name="section152" id="section152"></a>
§ <b>152.</b> The English verse, like the French decasyllabic, admits
feminine caesuras and feminine line-endings, and the first thesis
(anacrusis) may be absent; there are, therefore, sixteen varieties
theoretically possible.</p>

<p>This table at the same time also contains the formal exposition, and
indeed possibly the actual explanation (by suppression of the thesis
following the epic caesura), of such lines as may be regarded as lines
with lyric caesura, and are identical with these in regard to rhythm and
number of syllables. To this class belong the forms given under 10, 12,

<p>In this five-foot metre all the Germanic licences of the even-beat
rhythm may occur in the same way as in the other even-beat metres. The
caesura, for instance, may occur in both (or all three) varieties in the
five-foot verse of Chaucer and of many other poets, either after or
within any of the remaining feet. Hence the structure of this metrical
form gains to an extraordinary degree in complexity.</p>

<p>By the mere fact that the variations adduced above may also occur after
the first, third, and fourth foot, the number of verse-forms produced by
the above-mentioned types of caesura in<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_212" id="Pg_212" title="212"></a> combination with initial
truncation and the different kinds of verse-ending rises to sixty-four,
to say nothing of the other metrical licences due to inversion of
accent, level stress, and the presence of hypermetrical unaccented
syllables at the beginning, or in the middle and the end of the line. At
any rate, the varieties of even-beat metres, especially of the five-foot
verse, resulting from these metrical licences, are much more numerous
than those connected with the five main types of the alliterative
hemistich. The great diversity of rhythm allowed by this metrical theory
has, indeed, been objected to, but evidently without sufficient reason,
and, as it seems, only because of the unfamiliarity of the idea.</p>

<p><a name="section153" id="section153"></a>
§ <b>153.</b> This variable position of the caesura is, however, not found in
the earliest specimens of this metre presented to us in the two poems in
the Harl. MS. 2253 dating from the second half of the thirteenth
century, which are edited in Wright’s <cite>Specimens of Lyric Poetry</cite>, Nos.
xl and xli (wrongly numbered xlii).<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> These are written in tripartite
eight-lined, anisometrical stanzas of the form <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>5</sub> d<sub>7</sub>
d<sub>5</sub></em>, in which the fifth, sixth, and eighth lines are evidently of five
feet. Ten Brink,<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> it is true, says that he has not been able ‘to
convince himself that this was a genuine instance of a metre
which&mdash;whether in origin or character&mdash;might be identified with
Chaucer’s heroic verse, although in isolated instances it seems to
coincide with it’. According to my conviction, there is not the
slightest doubt as to the structure of these verses as lines of five
feet, and Ten Brink has not expressed any opinion as to the nature of
the verse to which they must otherwise be <span class="locked">referred.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>In both these poems there occur only verses of the type indicated by the
formulas 3, 4, 7, 12:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><span class="normal">3.</span> His hérte blód | he ȝéf for ál monkúnne. <span class="attrib">xl. 35.</span></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_213" id="Pg_213" title="213"></a></p>

<p>Among the Germanic licences the presence of a disyllabic initial or
internal thesis is most noticeable in these which are, so far as is
known, the earliest five-foot verses in English poetry; as, e.g. in xli.
33, 34:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

  </div>
</div>

<p><a name="section154" id="section154"></a>
§ <b>154.</b> The main difference between Chaucer’s five-foot verse and these
early specimens of this metre is that the caesura does not always occupy
a fixed place in it, but is liable to shift its position.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> It is
either masculine, epic, or lyric, and occurs chiefly after the second or
in and after the third foot, or in the fourth, so that there are thus
(in Chaucer’s verse and that of most of the following poets) <b>six main
types of caesura</b>:</p>

<p>1. Masculine (monosyllabic) caesura after the second foot; the principal
kind (types 1 and 3):</p>

<div class="iline">Whan Zéphirús | eek wíth his swéte bréethe. <span class="attrib">Prol. 5.</span></div>

<p>2. Feminine (disyllabic) epic caesura after the second foot; far rarer
(types 2 and 4):</p>

<div class="iline">To Cáunterbúry<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> | with fúl devóut coráge. <span class="attrib">ib. 22.</span></div>

<p>3. Feminine (disyllabic) lyric caesura in the third foot; more frequent
than the preceding (types 10 and 12):</p>

<div class="iline">And máde fórward | érly fór to rýse. <span class="attrib">ib. 83.</span></div>

<p>4. Masculine (monosyllabic) caesura after the third foot (first
subordinate type to 1 and 3 = 1 a and 3 a):</p>

<div class="iline">That slépen ál the níght | with ópen éye. <span class="attrib">ib. 10.</span></div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_214" id="Pg_214" title="214"></a></p>

<p>5. Feminine (disyllabic) epic caesura after the third foot, rare (first
subordinate type to 2 and 4 = 2a and 4a:</p>

<div class="iline">Ther ás he wás ful mérye | and wél át ése. <span class="attrib">Nonne Pr. T. 438.</span></div>

<p>6. Feminine lyric caesura in the fourth foot (first subordinate type to
10 and 12 = 10a and 12a):</p>

<div class="iline">An ánlas ánd a gípser | ál of sílk. <span class="attrib">Prol. 357.</span></div>

<p>Besides these six principal caesuras we also find all the three types
occurring in rarer instances in the corresponding remaining positions of
the verse, namely, after the first or in the second foot, and after the
fourth or in the fifth foot. Enjambement often gives rise to logical
caesuras in unusual positions, alongside of which another metrical
caesura is generally noticeable in one of the usual positions:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Byfél, || that ín that sésoun | ón a dáy. <span class="attrib">Prol. 18.</span></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>By the various combinations of such principal and subordinate caesuras
the number of the varieties of this metre is increased to an almost
unlimited extent. Many lines also are devoid of the caesura completely,
or, at most, admit, under the influence of the general rhythm, a light
metrical caesura without any strict logical need, as, for instance, when
it occurs after a conjunction or a preposition, as in the verses:</p>

<div class="lines-container">

  </div>
</div>

<p><a name="section155" id="section155"></a>
§ <b>155.</b> The end also of the line may be either masculine or feminine.
Both kinds occur side by side on a perfectly equal footing, the feminine
endings probably somewhat oftener in Chaucer’s verse owing to the
numerous terminations consisting of <em>e</em> or <em>e</em> + consonant which were
still pronounced at his time. Besides the variety in the caesura and the
end of the verse,<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_215" id="Pg_215" title="215"></a> the well-known licences of even-beat rhythm play a
considerable part; as, for instance, inversion of accent, ordinary and
rhetorical, at the beginning of the verse and after the caesura: rédy
<em>to wénden</em> Prol. 21; Sýngynge <em>he wás</em> ib. 91; Schórt <em>was his góune</em>
ib. 93; Tróuthe <em>and honóur</em>, frédom <em>and cóurteisíe</em> ib. 46.</p>

<p>Although omission of the anacrusis is on the whole unfrequent, it yet
undoubtedly occurs (cf. <a href="#Pg_137">p. 137</a>, <a href="#Footnote_129">footnote</a>):</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">

  </div>
</div>

<p>Disyllabic theses are often found initially and internally.</p>

<div class="lines-container">

  </div>
</div>

<p>Similar rhythmical phenomena are caused by the slurring of
syllables, such, e.g., as <em>Many a, tharray</em> from <em>the array</em>, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
in regard to which reference should be made to the chapter on
the metrical value of syllables.</p>

<p>Level stress occurs most frequently in Chaucer in rhyme: <em>f</em>i<em>ft</em>é<em>ne</em>:
<em>Trámasséne</em> 61&ndash;2; <em>d</em>a<em>gg</em>é<em>re</em>: <em>spere</em> 113&ndash;14; <em>thing</em>: <em>wr</em>i<em>t</em>ý<em>ng</em>
325&ndash;6. Enjambement and rhyme-breaking are used by him with great skill
(cf. §§ <a href="#section92">92</a>, <a href="#section93">93</a>)</p>

<p><a name="section156" id="section156"></a>
§ <b>156.</b> In later Middle English this metre on the whole retained the
same character, and individual poets vary from one another only in a few
points.</p>

<p>Of Gower’s five-foot verse only short specimens are preserved. Like his
four-foot verse, they are very generally regular. Inversion of accent is
the licence he most often employs. Gower uses almost exclusively the
masculine caesura after the second foot and the lyric caesura in the
third foot. But epic caesura also occasionally occurs in his verse:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Fór of batáille | the fínal énde is pés. <span class="attrib">Praise of Peace, 66.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A decline in the technique of the five-foot verse begins with Lydgate
and Hoccleve.</p>

<p>These writers deprived the caesura of its mobility and admitted it
almost exclusively after the second beat. Hoccleve uses hardly any
caesuras but the masculine and lyric, whilst in Lydgate’s verse epic
caesura is often met with (cf. p. <a href="#Pg_211">211</a>). Both indulge in the licences of
initial truncation and omission of the unaccented syllable after the
caesura (cf. l. c.) as well as level stress and the admission of several
unaccented syllables at the beginning of the verse and internally; there
are even cases of<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_216" id="Pg_216" title="216"></a> the omission of unaccented syllables in the middle of
the verse:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Of hárd márble | they díde anóther máke. <span class="attrib">Min. P., p. 85, 24.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The slight license of inversion of accent is also taken advantage
of.</p>

<p>Stephen Hawes and Barclay again imparted to this line greater freedom
with regard to the caesura. And yet the metre exhibits under their
hands, in consequence of the frequent occurrence of disyllabic initial
and internal theses, a somewhat uneven rhythm.</p>

<p>The ablest of the successors of Chaucer, in technique as in other
respects, are the Scots: Blind Harry, Henrysoun, King James I, Douglas,
and Dunbar. The verse of Dunbar, in particular, stands on an equality
with Chaucer’s in rhythmical euphony, while David Lyndesay often
struggles with difficulties of form, and, by frequent use of level
stress, offends against the first principle of even-beat rhythm, viz.
the coincidence of the metrical accent with the natural accentuation of
the word and sentence.</p>

<p><a name="section157" id="section157"></a>
§ <b>157.</b> In Modern English the rhymed five-foot verse remains
essentially the same as in the Middle English period. Feminine rhymes
are indeed rarer than in Middle English poetry in consequence of the
disuse of flexional endings.</p>

<p>For the same reason, and owing to the advance in technical execution,
the epic caesura is also rarer. Still, examples of this as well as of
the other kind of caesuras employed by Chaucer are found in Modern
English:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><span class="normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;I.</span> The níghtingále | with féathers néw she síngs. <span class="attrib">Sur. p. 3.</span></div>

    <div class="line"><span class="normal">&nbsp;VI.</span> At lást she ásked sóftly, | whó was thére. <span class="attrib">ib. 187.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In positions nearer to the beginning or the end of the line the
different kinds of caesura are also rare in Modern English, and occur
mostly in consequence of enjambements.</p>

<p>In Wyatt’s poems epic caesuras are found in comparatively<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_217" id="Pg_217" title="217"></a> large number;
in Spenser, on the other hand, they are probably entirely lacking, owing
to a finer feeling for the technique of the verse.</p>

<p>Inversions of accent occur in the usual positions and at all times with
all the poets. Level stress, on the other hand, is more frequently
detected in such poets as do not excel in technical skill, as, for
instance, in Wyatt and Donne, who also admit initial truncation, and
more rarely the omission of a thesis in the middle of the line. In their
poems disyllabic theses also often occur initially and internally, while
more careful poets more rarely permit themselves these licences. To
Wyatt’s charge must be laid further the unusual and uncouth licence of
unaccented rhyme, such rhymes, for example, as <em>begínnìng: eclípsìng</em>,
p. 56, 1&ndash;3; <em>dréadèth: séekèth</em>, <em>inclósèd: oppréssèd</em> 54, &amp;c. In
other poets this peculiarity is hardly ever found.</p>

<p><a name="section158" id="section158"></a>
§ <b>158.</b> In narrative poetry the five-foot verse rhyming in couplets,
<em>heroic verse</em>, was a favourite metre. As a close in the sense coincides
with that of each couplet, this metre tends to assume an epigrammatic
tone, especially since enjambement seldom occurs after the Restoration.
To avoid the monotony thus occasioned, many Restoration poets linked
three verses together by one and the same rhyme, whereby the regular
sequence of couplets was then interrupted wherever they pleased.
Sometimes such threefold rhymes (<em>triplets</em>) serve the purpose of laying
a special stress on particular passages, a practice which is, moreover,
to be observed as early as in some contemporaries of Shakespeare, e.g.
in Donne. A somewhat freer structure than that of the heroic verse is,
as a rule, exhibited by the five-foot line when employed in poems in
stanza form. In this verse a considerable part is played by enjambement.
This also holds good for the rhymed five-foot verse employed in dramatic
poetry, which usually rhymes in couplets, though alternate rhymes are
occasionally used.</p>

<p>After Lyly’s <cite>The Maid’s Metamorphosis</cite>, entirely written in heroic
verse, this metre was chiefly employed by Shakespeare and his
contemporaries for prologues and epilogues. Rhymed five-foot verses
frequently occur in Shakespeare’s earlier dramas, e.g. in <cite>Romeo and
Juliet</cite>, where their technical structure is found to be fairly strict.
In his later dramas, on the other hand, e.g. in the Prologue and
Epilogue to <cite>Henry VIII</cite>, the heroic verse is, on the analogy of the
freer treatment of his later blank verse, also more loosely constructed.
Enjambement, and<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_218" id="Pg_218" title="218"></a> the caesuras connected with it after the first and
fourth accents, are often met with.</p>

<p><a name="section159" id="section159"></a>
§ <b>159.</b> Dryden’s dramatic heroic verse does not differ essentially from
that of his satirical poems and translations. After Dryden returned to
blank verse for dramatic writing, heroic verse ceased to be employed for
this purpose. Rhymed verse, rhyming in couplets and stanzas, however,
still continued to be in vogue in lyrical, satirical, didactic, and
narrative poetry.</p>

<p>Pope’s heroic verse is still more uniformly constructed than that of
Dryden. Both poets hardly ever employ any caesura but the masculine and
the lyric after the second and third beat, and the end of the line is
almost exclusively masculine. Initial truncation or the absence of an
unaccented syllable internally is hardly to be met with in their poems.
The earlier diversity in the structure of this line was (under the
influence of the French models whom they closely imitated) considerably
restricted. Even transposition of accent occurs comparatively seldom, so
that the word-accent generally exactly coincides with the rhythmical
accent. Enjambement is, however, employed more frequently by Dryden than
by Pope; and the former, moreover, occasionally admits at the close of a
triplet a verse of six feet, while Pope, in his original poems,
completely avoids triplets as well as six-accent lines. The breaking of
rhyme both poets purposely exclude.</p>

<p>A similar uniform character is exhibited by the heroic verse of most of
the poets of the eighteenth century. It is not before the nineteenth
century that this metre, in spite of the persistence of individual
poets, e.g. Byron, in adhering to the fashion set by Pope, again
acquires greater freedom. Shelley and Browning, for instance, are fond
of combining lines of heroic verse by enjambement so as to form periods
of some length. Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey and others again admit
couplets and triplets with occasional six-foot lines at the close. But
the caesura remains nearly always restricted to the places which it
occupies in Pope’s verse, and the close of the line is masculine. Keats
only often indulges in feminine rhymes.</p>

<p>It is, however, remarkable that such rhymes more often occur in
five-foot verses combined in stanzas when employed for satirical and
comic compositions, as e.g. in Byron’s <cite>Beppo</cite> and <cite>Don Juan</cite>. In these
poems the disyllabic thesis, the slurring of syllables, and other
rhythmical licences, also more frequently occur.</p>

<p><a name="section160" id="section160"></a>
§ <b>160. The Beginnings of Modern English Poetry.</b> Puttenham, in his
<cite>Arte of English Poesie</cite>, i. 31, speaks of Surrey and Wyatt as having
originated the modern period of English poetry. This is true in so far
as their poems are the first to show clearly&mdash;especially in metrical
form&mdash;the influence of the spirit of the Renaissance, which had been
making itself felt in English Literature for some time past. The new
tendencies manifested themselves not only in the actual introduction of
new rhythms and verse-forms borrowed from Classical and Italian poetry,
but also in the endeavour to regulate and reform the native poetry
according to the metrical laws and peculiarities of foreign models,
especially of the ancient classics.</p>

<p>There were, indeed, several features of classical poetry which invited
imitation, and the introduction of which produced the chief differences
between Modern English and Middle English versification. These features
are:</p>

<p>First, the quantitative character of the ancient rhythms as opposed to
the accentual character of English verse. Secondly, the strict
separation of rising and falling rhythms. In Middle English we have only
the rising rhythm, which, however, sometimes becomes a falling one if
the first thesis is wanting. Finally, the absence of rhyme in the poetry
of the ancients, whereas in late Middle English poetry&mdash;apart from some
North-English and Scottish productions written in the conservative,
rhymeless form of the alliterative line&mdash;rhyme is all but universal.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_220" id="Pg_220" title="220"></a></p>
<p><a name="section161" id="section161"></a>
§ <b>161.</b> The heroic couplet, the most popular and most important metre
in later Middle English poetry, was, naturally, first of all influenced
by the new classical movement.</p>

<p>It was the Earl of Surrey who, by dispensing with the rhyme, first
transformed this metre into what is now known as Blank Verse. He adopted
the unrhymed decasyllabic line as the most suitable vehicle for his
translation of the second and fourth books of the <cite>Aeneid</cite>, written
about 1540. In so doing, he enriched modern literature with a new form
of verse which was destined to take a far more important place in
English poetry than he can have foreseen for it. In its original
function, as appropriate to the translation of ancient epic poetry, it
has been employed by many late writers, e.g. by Cowper in his version
of Homer; but this is only one, and the least considerable, of its many
applications. Shortly after Surrey’s time blank verse was used for court
drama by Sackville and Norton in their tragedy of <cite>Gorboduc</cite> (1561), and
for popular drama by Marlowe in <cite>Tamburlaine the Great</cite> (1587).</p>

<p>From the latter part of the sixteenth century onwards it has continued
to be the prevailing metre for dramatic poetry, except for a short time,
when its supremacy was disputed by the heroic couplet used by Lord
Orrery, Davenant, Dryden, and others. Meanwhile blank verse had also
become the metre of original epic poetry through Milton’s use of it in
his <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>; and in the eighteenth century it was applied to
descriptive and reflective poetry by Thomson and Young.</p>

<p>It is uncertain whether Surrey invented it himself on the basis of his
studies in classical rhymeless poetry, or whether he was influenced by
the example of the Italian poet Trissino (1478&ndash;1550), who, in his epic
<cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Italia liberata dai Goti</cite> and in his drama <cite>Sofonisba</cite>, introduced into
Italian poetry the rhymeless, eleven-syllabled verses known as <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">versi
sciolti</em> (sc. <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">della rima</em>, i.e. freed from rhyme). There are at least
no conclusive grounds for accepting the latter view, as there are some
peculiarities in Surrey’s blank verse which are not met with in
Trissino, e.g. the occurrence of incomplete lines, which may have been
introduced after the model of the unfinished lines found occasionally
amongst Vergil’s Latin hexameters.</p>

<p>Blank verse being in its origin only heroic verse without rhyme,<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> we
may refer for its general rhythmical structure to what we have said on
this metre. The rhythmical licences of this and the other iambic metres
discussed in §§ <a href="#section82">82&ndash;8</a> are common also to blank verse. But in addition to
these, blank<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_221" id="Pg_221" title="221"></a> verse has several other deviations from the normal rhymed
five-foot iambic verse, the emancipation from rhyme having had the
effect of producing greater variability of metrical structure. It is for
this reason it has been thought advisable to treat heroic verse and
blank verse in separate chapters.</p>

<p>At first, it is true, the two metres are very similar in character,
especially in Surrey; with the further and independent development of
blank verse, however, they diverge more and more.</p>

<p><a name="section162" id="section162"></a>
§ <b>162.</b> In conformity with Surrey’s practice in his heroic verse,
which, as we have seen, usually had masculine rhymes, his blank verse
has also as a rule masculine endings, and is thus distinguished not only
from Chaucer’s heroic verse, which frequently had feminine endings, but
from the blank verse of later poets like Shakespeare and some of his
contemporaries.</p>

<p>As to the principal kinds of the caesura after the second and third foot
there is no material difference between Surrey’s blank verse and the
heroic verse of the same period (cf. §§ <a href="#section154">154</a>, <a href="#section157">157</a>).</p>

<p>The Epic caesura occurs occasionally after the second foot, e.g.:</p>

<div class="iline">Líke to the ádder | with vénomous hérbes féd. <span class="attrib">p. 131;</span></div>

<p>but apparently not after the third, although it does not seem to have
been avoided on principle, as we often find lyric caesuras in this
place, and even after the fourth foot:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">His tále with ús | did púrchase crédit; || sóme</div>
    <div class="line">Trápt by decéit; | some fórced bý his téars. <span class="attrib">p. 120.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The run-on line (or enjambement) is already pretty frequently used by
Surrey (35 times in the first 250 lines), and this is one of the chief
distinctions between blank verse and heroic verse. In most instances the
use of run-on lines is deliberately adopted with a view to artistic
effect. The same may be said of the frequent inversion of rhythm. On the
other hand, it seldom happens that the flow of the metre is interrupted
by level stress, missing thesis, or the use of a disyllabic thesis at
the beginning or in the interior of the verse.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>

As to the peculiarities of the word-stress and the metrical treatment of
syllables in Surrey, the respective sections of the introductory remarks
should be consulted. Apart then from the metrical licences, of which it
admits in common with heroic verse, the most important peculiarities of
Surrey’s blank verse are the masculine endings, which are almost
exclusively used, and the frequent use of run-on lines.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_222" id="Pg_222" title="222"></a></p>

<p>Cf. the opening lines of the fourth book of his <cite>Aeneid</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>

<p><a name="section163" id="section163"></a>
§ <b>163.</b> With regard to the further development of this metre in the
drama of the second half of the sixteenth and the first half of the
seventeenth centuries we must restrict ourselves to a brief summary of
its most important peculiarities, for details referring the reader to
<cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, pp. 256&ndash;375; for bibliography see ib., pp. 259&ndash;60.</p>

<p>The employment of blank verse in the court drama hardly brought about
any change in its structure. In <cite>Gorboduc</cite>, apart from a few instances
in which a line is divided in the dialogue between two speakers
(generally two and three feet) and the occasional (for the most part no
doubt accidental) use of rhyme, the blank verse is exceedingly similar
to that of Surrey, having masculine endings with hardly any exceptions.</p>

<p>This character was maintained by blank verse in all the other court
plays of this time, only occasionally rhyming couplets are used at the
end of a scene in Gascoigne’s <cite>Iocasta</cite>, and prose passages now and then
occur in Lyly’s <cite>The Woman in the Moon</cite>.</p>

<p>The next and greatest step in the further development of the metre was
its introduction into the popular drama by no less a poet than Marlowe
in his drama <cite>Tamburlaine the Great</cite> (1587). Marlowe’s mastery over this
metrical form was supreme. His skill is shown in his use of the
inversion of accent, particularly the rhetorical inversion, to give
variety to his rhythm, e.g.:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_223" id="Pg_223" title="223"></a></p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Áh, sacred Máhomet, | thóu that hast seen</div>

    <div class="line">Míllions of Túrks | pérish by Támburláine.<span class="attrib">Tam. ii, p. 213.</span></div>

    <div class="line">But stíll the pórts were shút: | víllain, I sáy. <span class="attrib">ib., p. 206.</span></div>

    <div class="line">And hágs hówl for my déath | at Cháron’s shóre.</div>
         <div class="attribution">Vol. ii. 255.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In his practice with regard to the caesura, the suppression of the
anacrusis, and the use of disyllabic theses in the interior of the
verse, he differs little from his predecessors. One distinctive feature
of his verse is that he usually gives their full syllabic value to the
Teutonic inflexional endings (<em>-ed</em>, <em>-est</em>), as well as to the Romanic
noun- and adjective-suffixes; as <em>-iage</em>, <em>-iance</em>, <em>-ion</em>, <em>-eous</em>,
<em>-ial</em> &amp;c. (cf. §§ <a href="#section107">102&ndash;7</a>).</p>

<p>By a frequent use of these endings as full syllables which is not always
in conformity with the spoken language of his time, his verse obtains a
certain dignity and pathos; cf. the following lines:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Yét in my thóughts | shall Chríst be hónouréd. <span class="attrib">Tamb. ii, p. 148.</span></div>

    <div class="line">They sáy, | we áre a scáttered | nátión.<span class="attrib">Jew of M. <span class="fakesc">I</span>, Sc. i.</span></div>

    <div class="line">These métaphýsics | óf magíciáns.<span class="attrib">Faust. <span class="fakesc">I</span>, Sc. ii.</span></div>
  </div>

<p>Allied with this is the fact that Marlowe still has a great predilection
for masculine endings, although feminine endings are also met with now
and then, especially in his later plays. Run-on lines do not often
occur, but many two- and three-foot lines as well as heroic couplets are
found at the end of longer speeches, scenes, and acts.</p>

<p>The blank verse of Greene, Peele, Kyd, and Lodge has a similar structure
to that of Marlowe, especially as regards the prevalence of masculine
endings. The verse of Greene and Peele, however, is rather monotonous,
because generally the caesura occurs after the second foot. On the other
hand, the metre of Kyd and Lodge stands in this respect much nearer to
that of Marlowe and in general shows greater <span class="locked">variety.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></span></p>

§ <b>164. The blank verse of Shakespeare</b>,<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> which is of great interest
in itself, and moreover has been carefully examined<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_224" id="Pg_224" title="224"></a> during the last
decades from different points of view, requires to be discussed somewhat
more fully.</p>

<p>It is of the first importance to notice that Shakespeare’s rhythms have
different characteristic marks in each of the four periods of his career
which are generally accepted.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> For the determination of the dates of
his plays the metrical peculiarities are often of great value in the
absence of other evidence, or as confirming conclusions based on
chronological indications of a different kind; but theories on the dates
of the plays should not be built solely upon these metrical tests, as
has been done, for instance, by Fleay. Such criticisms, generally
speaking, have only a subordinate value, as, amongst others, F.J.
Furnivall has shown in his treatise <cite>The Succession of Shakespeare’s
works and the use of metrical tests in settling it</cite> (London, Smith,
Elder &amp; Co., 1877. 8º).</p>

<p>The differences in the treatment of the verse which are of greatest
importance as distinctive of the several periods of Shakespeare’s work
are the following:</p>

<p><a name="section165" id="section165"></a>
§ <b>165.</b> In the first place the numerical proportion of the rhymed and
rhymeless lines in a play deserves attention. Blank verse, it is true,
prevails in all Shakespeare’s plays; but in his undoubtedly earlier
plays we find a very large proportion of rhymed verse, while in the
later plays the proportion becomes very small.</p>

<p>Some statistical examples, based on careful researches by English and
German scholars, may be quoted to prove this; for the rest we refer to
the special investigations themselves.</p>

<p>In <cite>Love’s Labour’s Lost</cite>, one of Shakespeare’s earliest plays, we have
1028 rhymed lines and 579 unrhymed. In <cite>The Tempest</cite>, one of his last
plays, we find 1458 unrhymed and only two rhymed five-foot lines. In the
plays that lie between the dates of these two dramas the proportion of
rhymed and unrhymed verse lies between these two numbers. In <cite>Romeo and
Juliet</cite>, e.g. (which belongs to the end of Shakespeare’s first<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_225" id="Pg_225" title="225"></a> period,
though Fleay thought it a very early play) we have 2111 unrhymed and 486
rhymed five-foot lines; in <cite>Hamlet</cite> (belonging to the third period)
there are 2490 unrhymed and 81 rhymed lines.</p>

<p>In many cases, however, the use of rhyme in a play is connected with its
whole tone and character, or with that of certain scenes in it. The
frequency of rhymes in <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite> finds its explanation in the
lyrical character of this play. For the same reason <cite>A Midsummer Night’s
Dream</cite>, although it is certainly later than <cite>Love’s Labour’s Lost</cite> and
<cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>, shows a larger proportion of rhymed lines (878
blank: 731 rhymes). This seems sufficient to show that we cannot rely
exclusively on the statistical proportion of rhymed and unrhymed verses
in the different plays in order to determine their chronological order.</p>

<p><a name="section166" id="section166"></a>
§ <b>166.</b> The numerical proportion of feminine and masculine endings is
of similar value. In the early plays we find both masculine and feminine
endings; the masculine, however, prevail. The number of feminine endings
increases in the later plays. On this point Hertzberg has made accurate
statistical researches. According to him the proportion of feminine to
masculine endings is as follows:</p>

<p><cite>Love’s Labour’s Lost</cite> 4 per cent., <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite> 7 per cent.,
<cite>Richard III</cite> 18 per cent., <cite>Hamlet</cite> 25 per cent., <cite>Henry VIII</cite> 45·6 per
cent.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> This proportion, however, as has been shown by later
inquiries,<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> does not depend solely on the date of the composition,
but also on the contents and the tone of the diction, lines with
masculine endings prevailing in pathetic passages, and feminine endings
in unemotional dialogue, but also in passionate scenes, in disputations,
questions, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="section167" id="section167"></a>
§ <b>167.</b> The numerical proportion of what are called ‘weak’ and ‘light’
endings to the total number of verses in the different plays is
similarly of importance. These are a separate subdivision of the
masculine endings and are not to be confused with the feminine. They are
formed by monosyllabic words, which are of subordinate importance in the
syntactical structure of a sentence and therefore stand generally in
thesis (sometimes even forming part of the feminine ending of a line),
but which under the influence of the rhythm are used to carry the arsis.
To the ‘weak’ endings belong the monosyllabic con<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_226" id="Pg_226" title="226"></a>junctions and
prepositions if used in this way: <em>and</em>, <em>as</em>, <em>at</em>, <em>but</em> (<em>except</em>),
<em>by</em>, <em>for</em>, <em>in</em>, <em>if</em>, <em>on</em>, <em>nor</em>, <em>than</em>, <em>that</em>, <em>to</em>, <em>with</em>; as
e.g. in the three middle lines of the following passage taken from
<cite>Henry VIII</cite> (<span class="fakesc">III.</span> ii. 97&ndash;101):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line indent4">What thóugh I knów her vértuous</div>
    <div class="line">And wéll desérving? | Yét I knéw her fór</div>
    <div class="line">A spléeny Lútheran, | ánd not whólsome tó</div>
    <div class="line">Our cáuse, | that shé should lýe | i’ th’ bósom óf</div>
    <div class="line">Our hárd-rul’d  kíng.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The ‘light’ endings include a number of other monosyllabic words, viz.
articles, pronouns, auxiliary verbs, that are used by Shakespeare in a
similar way.</p>

<p>These are, according to Ingram, <em>am</em>, <em>are</em>, <em>art</em>, <em>be</em>, <em>been</em>, <em>but</em>
(=<em>only</em>), <em>can</em>, <em>could</em>, <em>did</em>(2), <em>do</em>(2), <em>does</em>(2), <em>dost</em>(2),
<em>ere</em>, <em>had</em>(2), <em>has</em>(2), <em>hast</em>(2), <em>have</em>(2), <em>he</em>, <em>how</em>(3), <em>I</em>,
<em>into</em>, <em>is</em>, <em>like</em>, <em>may</em>, <em>might</em>, <em>shall</em>, <em>shalt</em>, <em>she</em>, <em>should</em>,
<em>since</em>, <em>so</em>(4), <em>such</em>(4), <em>they</em>, <em>thou</em>, <em>though</em>, <em>through</em>,
<em>till</em>, <em>upon</em>, <em>was</em>, <em>we</em>, <em>were</em>, <em>what</em>(3), <em>when</em>(3), <em>where</em>(3),
<em>which</em>, <em>while</em>, <em>whilst</em>, <em>who</em>(3), <em>whom</em>(3), <em>why</em>(3), <em>will</em>,
<em>would</em>, <em>yet</em> (=<em>tamen</em>), <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>According to Ingram, the words marked (2) are to be regarded as light
endings ‘only when used as auxiliaries’; those marked (3), ‘when not
directly interrogative’; those marked (4), ‘when followed immediately by
<em>as</em>.’ <em>Such</em> belongs to this class, ‘when followed by a substantive
with an indefinite article, as <em>Such a man</em>.’

There are hardly any weak or light endings in the first and second
periods of Shakespeare’s work. In the third they occur now and then and
become more frequent in the last period. So we have e.g. in <cite>Antony and
Cleopatra</cite> (1600) 3·53 per cent.; in <cite>The Tempest</cite> (1610) 4·59 per
cent.; in <cite>Winter’s Tale</cite> (1611) 5·48 per cent.</p>

<p>In the application of this test we must chiefly keep in mind that these
two groups of words are only to be considered as ‘weak’ and ‘light’
endings when they form the last arsis of the line, as is the case in the
lines quoted from <cite>Henry VIII</cite>; but they are to be looked upon as part
of a disyllabic or feminine ending if they form a supernumerary thesis
following upon the last arsis:</p>

<div class="iline">Upón this groúnd; | and móre it woúld contént me.</div>
  <div class="attribution">Wint. <span class="fakesc">II.</span> i. 159</div>

<p><a name="section168" id="section168"></a>
§ <b>168.</b> Intimately connected with the quality of the line-<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_227" id="Pg_227" title="227"></a>endings is
the proportion of unstopt or ‘run-on’ and ‘end-stopt’ lines, or the
frequent or rare use the poet makes of enjambement. Like the feminine,
weak, and light endings, this metrical peculiarity also occurs much more
rarely in Shakespeare’s earlier than in his later plays. According to
Furnivall’s statistics, e.g. in <cite>Love’s Labour’s Lost</cite> one run-on line
occurs in 18·14 lines; in <cite>The Tempest</cite>, on the other hand, we have one
run-on line in 3·02 lines; in <cite>Winter’s Tale</cite> the proportion rises to
one in 2·12.</p>

<p>As in the later plays run-on lines are often the result of the use of
weak and light endings, we may perhaps assume with Hertzberg that at
times the poet deliberately intended to give a greater regularity to the
verse, if only by introducing the more customary masculine endings. From
this point of view, then, both the weak and light endings and the run-on
lines would have much less importance as metrical and chronological
tests than they otherwise might have had.</p>

<p><a name="section169" id="section169"></a>
§ <b>169.</b> But there is another peculiarity of Shakespeare’s rhythms
noticed by Hertzberg which is of greater value as a metrical test; viz.
the use of the full syllabic forms of the suffixes <em>-est</em>, and
especially of <em>-es</em> or <em>-eth</em> in the second and third pers. sing., as
well as that of <em>-ed</em> of the preterite and of the past participle. These
tests are all the more trustworthy because they do not so much arise
from a conscious choice on the part of the poet as from the historical
development of the language. This is indicated by the fact that the
slurring of these endings prevails more and more in the later plays.</p>

<p>According to Hertzberg’s statistics the proportion of fully sounded and
slurred <em>e</em> is as follows:</p>

<table summary ="hertzberg’s statistics" width="100%">
  <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><em>1 H. VI.</em></td><td><em>T. Andr.</em></td> <td><em>1 H. IV.</em></td> <td><em>H. VIII.</em></td></tr>
  <tr><td class="tdl">3 Pers. Sing.</td><td class="tdr">15·58%</td><td class="tdr">6·4%</td><td class="tdr">2·25%</td><td class="tdr">0%</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="tdl">Pret. and P.P.</td><td class="tdr">20·9%</td><td class="tdr">21·72%</td><td class="tdr">15·41%</td><td class="tdr">4·2%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>It thus appears that in this respect also there is a decided progress
from a more archaic and rigorous to a more modern usage.</p>

<p>These are the five chief distinctive marks of Shakespeare’s verse in the
different periods of his dramatic work. Besides these, Fleay has pointed
out some other characteristics distinctive of the first period, namely,
the more sparing use of Alexandrines, of shortened verses, and of prose,
and the more frequent use of doggerel verses, stanzas, sonnets, and
crossed rhymes.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_228" id="Pg_228" title="228"></a></p>

<p><a name="section170" id="section170"></a>
§ <b>170.</b> There are, however, some other rhythmical characteristics that
have not yet been sufficiently noticed by English or German scholars,
probably because they cannot be so easily represented by means of
statistics.</p>

<p>The caesura is of special importance. Although from the first
Shakespeare always allowed himself a great degree of variety in the
caesura, he prefers during his first and second period the masculine and
lyrical caesura after the second foot; in his third period, in <cite>Macbeth</cite>
especially, both the masculine and lyrical caesura occur as frequently
after the third foot, and side by side with these the epic caesura after
the second and third foot pretty often (§ <a href="#section90">90</a>); during the fourth period
a great many double caesuras occur corresponding to the numerous run-on
lines.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>The old-fashioned disyllabic pronunciation of certain Romanic
terminations (as <em>-ion</em>, <em>-ier</em>, <em>-iage</em>, <em>-ial</em>, &amp;c.), so often met
with in Marlowe, is not uncommon in Shakespeare, chiefly in his early
plays, but also in those of later date (cf. § <a href="#section107">107</a>).</p>

<p>As to inversion of rhythm (cf. § <a href="#section88">88</a>), it is a noteworthy feature that
during the first period it occurs chiefly in the first foot and
afterwards often in the third also.</p>

<p>Disyllabic theses may be found in each of the five feet, sometimes even
two at the same time:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Having Gód, her cónscience, | ánd these bárs agaínst me.</div>
      <div class="attribution">R. III, <span class="fakesc">I.</span> ii. 235.</div>

    <div class="line">Succéeding his fáther Bólingbróke, | did réign.</div>
      <div class="attribution">1 H. VI, <span class="fakesc">II.</span>  v. 83.</div>

      <div class="attribution">1 H. VI, <span class="fakesc">I.</span> iii. 111.</div>

    <div class="line">Thén is he móre behólding | to yóu than Í.</div>
      <div class="attribution">R. III, <span class="fakesc">III.</span> i. 107.</div>

      <div class="attribution">H. VIII, <span class="fakesc">I.</span> i. 222.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Disyllabic or polysyllabic line-endings are likewise of frequent
occurrence:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">I dáre avóuch it, sír, what, fífty fóllowers? <span class="attrib">Lear, <span class="fakesc">II.</span> iv. 240.</span></div>

    <div class="line">To yóur own cónscience, sír, befóre Políxenes. <span class="attrib">Wint. <span class="fakesc">III.</span> ii. 47.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_229" id="Pg_229" title="229"></a></p>

<p>Slurring and other modifications of words to make them fit into the
rhythm are very numerous and of great variety in Shakespeare; we have
referred to them before, §§ <a href="#section108">108&ndash;11</a>; here only some examples may be
repeated, as (<em>a</em>)<em>bove</em>, (<em>be</em>)<em>cause</em>, (<em>ar</em>)<em>rested</em>, <em>th’ other</em>, <em>th’
earth</em>, <em>whe</em>(<em>th</em>)<em>er</em>, <em>ha</em>(<em>v</em>)<em>ing</em>, <em>e</em>(<em>v</em>)<em>il</em>, <em>eas</em>(<em>i)ly</em>, <em>barb</em>(<em>a</em>)<em>rous</em>,
<em>inn</em>(<em>o</em>)<em>cent</em>, <em>acquit</em> for <em>acquitted</em>, <em>deject</em> for <em>dejected</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many lengthenings also occur, as <em>wrest(e)ler</em> A. Y.
L. <span class="fakesc">II.</span> ii, 13; <em>pilg(e)rim</em> All’s Well, <span class="fakesc">III.</span> v. 43, &amp;c. (Cf. §§ <a href="#section87">87</a>,
<a href="#section112">112</a>.)</p>

<p>In some monosyllabic words, as <em>fear</em>, <em>dear</em>, <em>hear</em>, <em>wear</em>, <em>tear</em>,
<em>year</em>, it is not always necessary to assume with Abbott (§§ 480&ndash;6) a
disyllabic pronunciation, e.g. <em>déàr</em>, <em>yéàr</em>. On the contrary, in many
cases it is more probable that the emphasis laid on the monosyllable
takes the place of the missing thesis, e.g.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">The kíng would spéak with Córnwall: | the déar fáther.</div>
      <div class="attribution">Lear, <span class="fakesc">II.</span> iv. 102.</div>

    <div class="line">Déar my lórd, | íf you in yóur own próof.</div>
      <div class="attribution">Ado, <span class="fakesc">IV.</span> i. 46.</div>

    <div class="line"><span class="normal">Hor.</span> Whére my lórd? | <span class="normal">Haml.</span> In my mínd’s éye, Horátio.</div>
      <div class="attribution">Ham. <span class="fakesc">I.</span> ii. 185.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The two last examples also show the absence of the first thesis, which
often occurs in Shakespeare; frequently, as in these cases, it is
compensated by an extra stress laid on the first accented syllable (cf.
§ <a href="#section84">84</a>); e.g.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Stáy! | the kíng has thrówn | his wárder dówn.</div>
      <div class="attribution">Rich. II, <span class="fakesc">I.</span> iii. 118.</div>

    <div class="line">Upón your Gráce’s part; | bláck and féarful.</div>
      <div class="attribution">All’s Well, <span class="fakesc">III.</span> i. 4.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>For the same reason a thesis is sometimes wanting in the interior of a
line:</p>

<div class="iline">Of góodly thóusands. | Bút, for áll thís.<span class="attrib">Macb. <span class="fakesc">IV.</span> iii. 44;</span></div>

<p>or for phonetic reasons (cf. § <a href="#section86">86</a>):</p>

<div class="iline">A thírd thínks, | withóut expénse at áll. <span class="attrib">1 Hen. VI, <span class="fakesc">I.</span> i. 76.</span></div>

<p>With respect to the word-stress and the metrical value of syllables
there are in Shakespeare many archaic peculiarities. Some of those we
have already dealt with; for the rest the reader must consult the works
in which they are specially discussed.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_230" id="Pg_230" title="230"></a></p>

<p><a name="section171" id="section171"></a>
§ <b>171.</b> Of great interest are the other metres that occur in
combination with blank verse in Shakespeare’s plays.</p>

<p>Alexandrines are frequently met with, especially where one line is
divided between two speakers:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line"><span class="normal">Macb.</span> I’ll cóme to yóu anón. | <span class="normal">Murd.</span> We áre resólved, my lórd.</div>
       <div class="attribution">Macb. <span class="fakesc">III.</span> i. 139.</div>

    <div class="line"><span class="normal">Macb.</span> Hów does your pátient, dóctor? | <span class="normal">Doct.</span> Nót so síck, my lórd.</div>
       <div class="attribution">ib. <span class="fakesc">V.</span> iii. 37;</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>but also in many other cases:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">Hów dares thy hársh rude tóngue | sound thís unpléasing néws?</div>
       <div class="attribution">R. II, <span class="fakesc">III.</span> iv. 74.</div>

    <div class="line">And thése does shé applý | for wárnings, ánd porténts.</div>
       <div class="attribution">Caes. <span class="fakesc">II.</span> ii. 80.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Frequently, however, such apparent Alexandrines can easily be read as
regular five-foot lines, for which they were certainly intended by the
poet, by means of the ordinary metrical licences, as slurring, double
theses, epic caesuras, or feminine endings<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>; e.g.:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">I had thóught, my lórd, | to have léarn’d  his héalth of yóu.</div>
       <div class="attribution">R. II, <span class="fakesc">II.</span> iii. 24.</div>

    <div class="line">I prómise you, | Í am afráid | to héar you téll it.</div>
       <div class="attribution">R. III, <span class="fakesc">I.</span> iv. 65.</div>

       <div class="attribution">Haml. <span class="fakesc">IV.</span> v. 102.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Among the blank verse lines in Shakespeare’s plays there are sometimes
interspersed examples of the native four-beat long line. This occurs,
apart from lyrical passages, most frequently in the early plays, e.g.
in <cite>Love’s Labour’s Lost</cite> and in <cite>The Comedy of Errors</cite>, <span class="fakesc">III.</span> i. 11&ndash;84,
from which the following specimen is taken:</p>

<div class="drama-container">
  <div class="drama">
    <div class="speaker"><span class="normal">Ant. E.</span> I thínk thou art an áss. |</div>
    <div class="speaker"><span class="normal">Dro. E.</span> <span class="hemistich">Marry, só it doth appéar</span></div>
    <div class="line14">By the wróngs I súffer | and the blóws I béar.</div>
    <div class="line14">I should kíck, being kíck’d; | and, béing at that páss,</div>
    <div class="line14">You would kéep from my héels | and bewáre of an áss.</div>
    <div class="speaker"><span class="normal">Ant. E.</span> You’re sád, Signior Bálthasar: | pray Gód our chéer</div>
    <div class="line14">May ánswer my good wíll | and your good wélcome hére.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_231" id="Pg_231" title="231"></a></p>

<p>Occasionally these verses exhibit a somewhat more extended
structure, so that they might pass for Alexandrines; mostly,
however, a line of this type is connected by rhyme with an
unmistakable four-beat line; cf.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">If thóu hadst been, Drómio, | to dáy in my pláce,</div>
    <div class="line">Thou wouldst have changed thy fáce for a náme, | or thy náme</div>
    <div class="line indent4">for an áss.</div>
    <div class="attribution">Com. of Err. <span class="fakesc">III.</span> i. 47.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>For this reason the second line also is to be scanned somehow or
other in conformity with the general four-beat rhythm of the passage;
possibly we should assume an initial thesis of five syllables. In
lyrical passages four-beat lines are often combined also with four-foot
iambic verse of the freer type (cf. § 132); e.g. in the following
passage from <cite>Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite>, <span class="fakesc">II.</span> i. 2&ndash;7:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Over híll, over dále, | thorough búsh, thorough bríer,</div>
    <div class="line">Over párk, over pále, | thorough flóod, thorough fíre,</div>
    <div class="line">I do wánder évery whére,</div>
    <div class="line">Swífter thán the móon’s sphére;</div>
    <div class="line">Ánd I sérve the fáiry quéen,</div>
    <div class="line">To déw her órbs upón the gréen, <span class="normal">&amp;c.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The two first lines belong to the first, the following to the latter
species. Sometimes the rhythm of such rhymed four-foot verses is purely
trochaic, e.g. in the witches’ song in Macbeth, <span class="fakesc">IV</span>, sc. i.</p>

<p>There are also unrhymed iambic lines of four feet, which usually have a

<p>Isolated two- and three-foot lines occur mostly at the beginning or at
the end of a speech, or in pathetic passages of monologues; this usually
causes a somewhat longer pause, such as is suitable to the state of
feeling of the speaker.</p>

<p>Short exclamations as <em>Why</em>, <em>Fie</em>, <em>Alack</em>, <em>Farewell</em> are often to be
regarded as extra-metrical.</p>

<p>Prose also is often used for common speeches not requiring poetic
diction.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>.</p>

§ <b>173.</b> The further development of blank verse can be dealt with here
only very briefly.</p>

<p>For the dramatic blank verse of Shakespeare’s contemporaries and
immediate successors see <cite>Metrik</cite>, vol. ii, §§ 167&ndash;78, and the works
there enumerated. The reader may also be referred to various special
treatises<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> of later date, which supply detailed evidence in the main
confirming the correctness of the author’s former observations.</p>

<p>In this place we mention only the characteristic peculiarities of the
most important poets of that group.</p>

<p><b>Ben Jonson’s blank verse</b> is not so melodious as that of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>There is often a conflict between the logical and the rhythmical stress,
as e.g.:</p>

<div class="iline">Be éver cáll’d  | the fóuntayne óf selfe-lóve. <span class="attrib">Cynthia’s Rev. <span class="fakesc">I.</span> ii.</span></div>


<p>Theses of two and even more syllables likewise occur in many verses,
e.g.:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_234" id="Pg_234" title="234"></a></p>

<div class="iline">Sir Péter Túb was his fáther, | a saltpétre mán.</div>
  <div class="attribution">Tale of a Tub, <span class="fakesc">I.</span> 22;</div>

<p>frequently also feminine or even disyllabic unaccented endings are used:</p>

<div class="iline">The dífference ’twíxt | the cóvetous ánd the pródigal.</div>
   <div class="attribution">Staple of News, <span class="fakesc">I.</span> iii. 39.</div>


<p>These licences often give to his verse an uneven and rugged rhythm.</p>

<p>There are only slight differences from Shakespeare’s usage with regard
to the caesura, inversion of accent, &amp;c. Run-on lines, as well as rhyme
and the use of prose, are common in his plays; some of his comedies are
almost entirely written in prose.</p>

<p><a name="section174" id="section174"></a>
§ <b>174.</b> In <b>Fletcher</b>, on the contrary, run-on lines, rhymed verses,
and prose are exceedingly rare.</p>

<p>Feminine and gliding endings, however (sometimes of three, and even of
four supernumerary syllables), are often used; in some plays even more
often than masculine ones. (For specimens cf. § <a href="#section91">91</a>.)</p>

<p>Feminine endings, combined with disyllabic or polysyllabic first thesis,
are common; now and then we find epic caesuras or other theses in the
interior of the line:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
   <div class="line">They are too hígh a méat that wáy, | they rún to jelly.</div>
    <div class="attribution">Loyal Subj. <span class="fakesc">I.</span> i. 371.</div>

   <div class="line">A cóach and four hórses | cánnot dráw me fróm it.</div>

   <div class="line">Thís was hard fórtune; | but íf alíve and táken.</div>

    <div class="attribution">Loyal Subj. <span class="fakesc">I.</span> ii. 314.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It deserves particular notice that in such feminine endings or epic
caesuras, where the superfluous thesis consists of one monosyllabic
word, this very often has something of a subordinate accent:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
   <div class="line">And lét sóme létters | tó that énd be féign’d  tòo.</div>

<p><a name="section175" id="section175"></a>
§ <b>175.</b> There are no plays extant written by <b>Beaumont</b> alone; plays,
however, from Fletcher’s pen alone do exist, and we can thus gain a
clear insight into the distinctive features of his rhythm and style, and
are so enabled to determine with some prospect of certainty the share
which Beaumont had in the plays due to their joint-authorship. This has
been attempted with some success by Fleay, and especially by <span class="locked">Boyle.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>The characteristics of Beaumont’s style and versification may be summed
up as follows:</p>

<p>He often uses prose and verse, rhymed and unrhymed verses in the same
speech; feminine endings occur rarely, but there are many run-on lines;
occasionally we find ‘light’ and ‘weak’ endings; double theses at the
beginning and in the interior of the line are met with only very seldom.
His verse, therefore, is widely different from Fletcher’s; cf. the
following passage from <cite>The Maid’s Tragedy</cite> (<span class="fakesc">II.</span> i, pp. 24&ndash;5):</p>

<div class="drama-container">

§ <b>176.</b> Fewer peculiarities appear in the verse of <b>Massinger</b>, who
(according to Fleay and Boyle) wrote many plays in partnership with
Beaumont and Fletcher; for this reason his verse has been examined by
those scholars in connexion with that of Beaumont and Fletcher. Like
Fletcher, Massinger uses a great many feminine endings; but he has many
run-on lines as well as ‘light’ and ‘weak’ endings. In
contradistinction to Beaumont’s practice, he seldom uses prose and
rhyme, but he has a great many double endings. His verse is very
melodious, similar on the whole to that of Shakespeare’s middle period.</p>

<p>The versification of the other dramatists of this time cannot be
discussed in this place. It must suffice to say that the more defined
and artistic blank verse, introduced by Marlowe and Shakespeare, was
cultivated by Beaumont, Massinger, Chapman, Dekker, Ford, &amp;c.; a less
artistic verse, on the other hand, so irregular as sometimes to
approximate to prose, is found in Ben Jonson and Fletcher, and to a less
degree in Middleton, Marston, and Shirley. (Cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii. §§ 171&ndash;8.)</p>

<p><a name="section177" id="section177"></a>
§ <b>177. The blank verse of Milton</b>, who was the first since Surrey to
use it for epic poetry, is of greater importance than that of the minor
dramatists, and is itself of particular interest. Milton’s verse, it is
true, cannot be said to be always very melodious. On the contrary, it
sometimes can be brought into conformity with the regular scheme of the
five-foot verse only by level stress and by assigning full value to
syllables that in ordinary pronunciation are slurred or elided (see §
<a href="#section83">83</a>).</p>

<p>Generally, however, Milton’s blank verse has a stately rhythmical
structure all its own, due to his masterly employment of the whole range
of metrical artifices. In the first place, he frequently employs
inversion of accent, both at the beginning of a line and after a
caesura; sometimes together with double thesis in the interior of the
line, as e.g.:</p>

<div class="iline">Báck to the gátes of Héaven; | the súlphurous háil.</div>
   <div class="attribution">Par. Lost, <span class="fakesc">I.</span> 171.</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_238" id="Pg_238" title="238"></a></p>

<p>Quite peculiar, however, to Milton’s blank verse is the extensive use he
makes of run-on lines, and in connexion with the great variety in his
treatment of the caesura.</p>

<p>Milton has more than 50 per cent. run-on lines; sometimes we have from
three to six lines in succession that are not stopt.</p>

<p>As to the caesura, we mostly have masculine and lyric caesura (more
seldom epic caesuras) after the second or third foot; besides, we have
frequent double caesuras (generally caused by run-on lines), about 12
per <span class="locked">cent.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, as the third peculiarity of Milton’s epic blank verse, the
almost exclusive use of masculine endings deserves mention. The number
of feminine endings in the various books of <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> and of
<cite>Paradise Regained</cite> is only from 1 to 5 per cent.; in <cite>Samson
Agonistes</cite>, on the other hand, we have about 16 per cent., nearly as
many as in the plays of Shakespeare’s second <span class="locked">period.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>The following example (<cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, <span class="fakesc">V.</span> 1&ndash;25) may illustrate Milton’s
blank verse:</p>

§ <b>178. The dramatic blank verse of the Restoration</b> is strongly
influenced by the heroic verse of the same period, and is on this
account very different from the blank verse of Shakespeare and his
contemporaries.</p>

<p>For this period the blank verse of Dryden is most interesting; he uses
it with great skill, but also with great restriction of its former
licences.</p>

<p>Even the number of the inversions of accent decreases considerably and
is only about 12 per cent. We find scarcely any examples of double
thesis, slurring of syllables, missing theses in the beginning or in the
interior of the line, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The caesura, which is the chief means by which variety is imparted to
the metre, is generally masculine or lyric, and as a rule occurs after
the second or third foot; occasionally we have double caesuras. Epic
caesuras are rare, if they occur at all. Feminine endings are frequent,
their proportion being about 25 to 28 per cent. Light and weak endings
are rarely to be found amongst the masculine endings, nor are run-on
lines (about 20 per cent.) frequently used by Dryden.</p>

<p>Most of the characteristic features of his blank verse will be found
exemplified in the following extract:</p>

<p>The blank verse of Lee, Otway, N. Rowe, and Addison<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> is
of similar structure.</p>

<p>The blank verse of Young (<cite>Night Thoughts</cite>), Cowper (<cite>The Task</cite>), and

uniform structure; cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §193</p>

<p><a name="section180" id="section180"></a>
§ <b>180.</b> In the <b>blank verse of the nineteenth century</b> we find both
tendencies, the strict and the free treatment of this verse-form;
according to their predominant employment in epic and dramatic poetry
respectively, we may call them the epic and the dramatic form of the
verse. They may be chiefly distinguished by the peculiarities to be
observed in the blank<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_241" id="Pg_241" title="241"></a> verse of Milton and Thomson on the one hand, and
of Dryden on the other; i.e. by the admission or exclusion of feminine
endings.</p>

<p>The strict form of the epic blank verse, with masculine endings, is
preferred in the narrative or reflective poems of Coleridge, Wordsworth,
Southey, Shelley, Keats, W.S. Landor, Longfellow, D. G. Rossetti, Mrs.
Browning, Robert Browning, Matthew Arnold, Tennyson, Swinburne, and
Edwin <span class="locked">Arnold.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>The free form is represented, mainly, in the dramatic verse of the same
and other poets, being used by Coleridge (in his translation of <cite>The
Piccolomini</cite>), Wordsworth, Southey, Lamb, Byron, Shelley, W.S. Landor,
Tennyson, Matthew Arnold, and <span class="locked">others.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER  XIII<br />

<span class="subtitle">TROCHAIC METRES</span></h3>

<p><a name="section181" id="section181"></a>
§ <b>181.</b> Trochaic metres, which, generally speaking, are less common in
English poetry than iambics, were not used at all till the Modern
English Period. The old metrical writers (Gascoigne, James VI, W. Webbe)
only know rising metres.</p>

<p>Puttenham (1589) is the first metrician who quotes four-foot trochaic
lines; similar verses also occur during the same period in Shakespeare’s
<cite>Love’s Labour’s Lost</cite>, <cite>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite>, and other plays.</p>

<p>Whether they were introduced directly on foreign models, or originated
indirectly from the influence of the study of the ancients by means of a
regular omission of the first thesis of the iambic metres, we do not
know. It is likewise uncertain who was the first to use strict trochaic
verses deliberately in English, or in what chronological order the
various trochaic metres formed in analogy with the iambic ones entered
into English poetry.</p>

<p>The longest trochaic lines, to which we first turn our attention, seem
to be of comparatively late date.</p>

<p>The <b>eight-foot trochaic line</b>, more exactly definable as the
acatalectic trochaic tetrameter (cf. § <a href="#section77">77</a>), is the longest trochaic
metre we find in English poetry. As a specimen of this metre the first
stanza of a short poem by Thackeray written in this form has been quoted
already on page <a href="#Pg_127">127</a>. As a rule, however, this acatalectic feminine line
is mingled with catalectic verses with masculine endings, as e.g. in the
following burlesque by Thackeray, <cite>Damages Two Hundred Pounds</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Só, God bléss the Spécial Júry! | príde and jóy of Énglish gróund,</div>
    <div class="line">Ánd the háppy lánd of Éngland, | whére true jústice dóes abóund!</div>
    <div class="line">Brítish júrymén and húsbands, | lét us háil this vérdict próper:</div>
    <div class="line">Íf a Brítish wífe offénds you, | Brítons, yóu’ve a ríght to whóp her.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_243" id="Pg_243" title="243"></a></p>

<p>While the catalectic iambic tetrameter is a line of seven feet (the last
arsis being omitted), the catalectic trochaic tetrameter loses only the
last thesis, but keeps the preceding arsis; and on this account it
remains a metre of eight feet.</p>

<p>Rhyming couplets of this kind of verse, when broken up into short lines,
give rise to stanzas with the formulas <em>a~b c~b<sub>4</sub>, d~e~f~e~<sub>4</sub></em>, or, if
inserted rhymes are used, we have the form <em>a~b a~b<sub>4</sub></em> (alternating
masculine and feminine endings), or <em>a~b~a~b~<sub>4</sub></em> (if there are feminine
endings only). In both these cases the eight-foot rhythm is distinctly
preserved to the ear. But this is no longer the case in another trochaic
metre of eight feet, where the theses of both the fourth and the eighth
foot are wanting, as may be noticed in Swinburne, <cite>A Midsummer Holiday</cite>,
p. 132:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Scárce two húndred yéars are góne, | ánd the wórld is pást awáy</div>
    <div class="line">Ás a nóise of bráwling wínd, | ás a flásh of bréaking fóam,</div>
    <div class="line">Thát behéld the sínger bórn | whó raised úp the déad of Róme;</div>
    <div class="line">Ánd a míghtier nów than hé | bíds him tóo rise úp to-dáy;</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>still less when such lines are broken up by inserted rhyme in stanzas of
the form <em>a b a b<sub>4</sub></em>. In cases, too, where the eight-foot trochaic
verse is broken up by leonine rhyme, the rhythm has a decided four-foot
cadence on account of the rapid recurrence of the rhyme.</p>

<p><a name="section182" id="section182"></a>
§ <b>182.</b> The <b>seven-foot trochaic line</b> is theoretically either
a brachycatalectic tetrameter with a feminine or a hypercatalectic
trimeter with a masculine ending. An example of the first kind
we had on p. <a href="#Pg_128">128</a>. A more correct specimen is the following
line from the same poem:</p>

<div class="iline">Hásten, Lórd, who árt my Hélper; | lét thine áid be spéedy.</div>

<p>The verses quoted on p. <a href="#Pg_128">128</a> are incorrect in so far as the
caesura occurs at an unusual place, viz. in the middle of the
fourth foot, instead of after it, as in the example just quoted.</p>

<p>They show, however, the origin of a pretty frequently occurring
anisorhythmical stanza, which is derived from this metre
by means of the use of inserted rhyme; lines 1 and 3
having a trochaic, lines 2 and 4, on the other hand, an iambic<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_244" id="Pg_244" title="244"></a>
rhythm; cf. e.g. the following stanza from a poem by Suckling
(<cite>Poets</cite>, iii. 741):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Sáy, but díd you lóve so lóng?</div>
    <div class="line indent2">In trúth I néeds must bláme you:</div>
    <div class="line">Pássion did your júdgement wróng,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Or wánt of réason sháme you.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When there are masculine rhymes throughout, the stanza is felt
distinctly as consisting of alternate lines of four and three feet (<em>a<sub>4</sub>
b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>).</p>

<p>The seven-foot rhythm, however, remains, if the three-foot half-lines
only have masculine endings, and the four-foot half-lines remain
feminine; as is the case in Swinburne’s poem <cite>Clear the Way</cite> (<cite>Mids.
Hol.</cite>, p. 143):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Cléar the wáy, my lórds and láckeys, | yóu have hád your dáy.</div>
    <div class="line">Hére you háve your ánswer, Éngland’s | yéa against your náy;</div>
    <div class="line">Lóng enóugh your hóuse has héld you: | up, and cléar the wáy!</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This, of course, is likewise the case, if the verses are broken up into
stanzas by inserted rhyme (<em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>).</p>

<p>More frequently than this correct seven-foot verse, with either a
feminine or masculine ending, we find the incorrect type, consisting of
a catalectic and a brachycatalectic dimeter, according to the model of
the well-known Low Latin verse:</p>

<div class="center ital">Mihi est propositum | in taberna mori,</div>

<p>which is often confounded with the former (cf. § <a href="#section135">135</a>). The following
first stanza of a poem by Suckling (<cite>Poets</cite>, iii. 471) is written in
exact imitation of this metre:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Óut upón it, Í have lóved | thrée whole dáys tógether;</div>
    <div class="line">Ánd am líke to lóve three móre, | íf it próve fair wéather.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Although only the long lines rhyme, the stanza is commonly printed in
short lines (<em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> ~ c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> ~</em>). Still more frequently we find
short-lined stanzas of the kind (<em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> ~ a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> ~</em>) as well as the other
sub-species with masculine rhymes only: <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>.</p>

<p><a name="section183" id="section183"></a>
§ <b>183.</b> The <b>six-foot trochaic line</b> occurs chiefly in Modern English,
and appears both in acatalectic (feminine)<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_245" id="Pg_245" title="245"></a> and catalectic (masculine)
form; e.g. in Swinburne <cite>The Last Oracle</cite> (<cite>Poems and Ballads</cite>, ii. 1):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Dáy by dáy thy shádow | shínes in héaven behólden,</div>
    <div class="line">Éven the sún, the shíning | shádow óf thy fáce:</div>
    <div class="line">Kíng, the wáys of héaven | befóre thy féet grow gólden;</div>
    <div class="line">Gód, the sóul of éarth | is kíndled wíth thy gráce.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Strictly the caesura ought to occur after the third foot, as it does in
the first line; generally, however, it is within the third foot, and so
this metre as well as the stanza formed by insertion of rhyme acquires
an anisorhythmical character, as e.g. in the following quatrain by
Moore:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Áll that’s bríght must fáde,&mdash;</div>
    <div class="line indent2">The bríghtest stíll the fléetest;</div>
    <div class="line">Áll that’s swéet was máde</div>
    <div class="line indent2">But to be lóst when swéetest.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When masculine rhymes are used throughout, the six-foot rhythm is
preserved in anisorhythmical stanzas of this kind just as well as when
lines like the first of those in the example quoted above, <cite>Day by day</cite>,
&amp;c., are broken up by inserted rhymes (<em>a ~ b ~ a ~ b<sub>3</sub> ~</em>); or again
when they have masculine endings in the second half-lines (<em>a ~ b a ~
b<sub>3</sub></em>). If the first half is masculine, however, and the second feminine
(or if both have masculine endings on account of a pause caused by the
missing thesis), the verses have a three-foot character, e.g. in Moore:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Whíle I tóuch the stríng,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Wréathe my bróws with láurel,</div>
    <div class="line">Fór the tále I síng</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Hás for ónce a móral.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a name="section184" id="section184"></a>
§ <b>184.</b> The <b>five-foot trochaic line</b> also occurs both in acatalectic
(feminine) and catalectic (masculine) form, and each of them is found in
stanzas rhyming alternately, as e.g. in Mrs. Hemans’s <cite>O ye voices</cite>
(vii. 57):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Ó ye vóices róund | my ówn hearth sínging!</div>
    <div class="line">Ás the wínds of Máy | to mémory swéet,</div>
    <div class="line">Míght I yét retúrn, | a wórn heart brínging,</div>
    <div class="line">Wóuld those vérnal tónes | the wánderer gréet?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Such verses, of course, can be used also in stanzas with either
masculine or feminine endings only.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_246" id="Pg_246" title="246"></a></p>

<p>As in the five-foot iambic verse, the caesura generally occurs either
after the second or third foot (in which case it is feminine), or
usually within the second or third foot (masculine caesura).</p>

<p>In a few cases this metre is also used without rhyme; e.g. in Robert
Browning’s <cite>One Word More</cite> (v. 313&ndash;21); feminine endings are used here
throughout; run-on lines occasionally occur, and the caesura shows still
greater variety in consequence. A specimen is given in <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §
217</p>

<p><a name="section185" id="section185"></a>
§ <b>185.</b> The <b>four-foot trochaic line</b> (discussed above in its
relationship to the eight- and seven-foot verse) is the most frequent of
all trochaic metres. It likewise occurs either with alternate feminine
and masculine rhymes or with rhymes of one kind only. We find it both in
stanzas and in continuous verse. The latter form, with feminine rhymes
only, we have in Shakespeare’s <cite>Tempest</cite>, <span class="fakesc">IV.</span> i. 106&ndash;9:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
   <div class="line">Hónour, ríches, márriage-bléssing,</div>
   <div class="line">Lóng contínuance, ánd incréasing,</div>
   <div class="line">Hóurly jóys be stíll upón you!</div>
   <div class="line">Júno síngs her bléssings ón you, <span class="normal">&amp;c.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>With masculine endings only it is found in <cite>Love’s Labour’s Lost</cite>, <span class="fakesc">IV.</span>
iii. 101:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
   <div class="line">Ón a dáy&mdash;aláck the dáy!&mdash;</div>
   <div class="line">Lóve, whose mónth is éver Máy,</div>
   <div class="line">Spíed a blóssom pássing fáir</div>
   <div class="line">Pláying ín the wánton áir.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>As in the five-foot verse, here also the caesura if used at all may fall
at different places; mostly its place is after or within the second
foot.</p>

<p>Generally speaking this metre is used in continuous verse in such a way
that masculine and feminine couplets are intermixed without regular
order;<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> when it is used in stanzas the forms previously mentioned in
§ <a href="#section181">181</a> are usually adopted.</p>

<p>This metre is used also, in an unrhymed form and with feminine endings
throughout, in Longfellow’s <cite>Song of Hiawatha</cite>, in which there are
noticeably more run-on lines than in rhymed four-foot trochaics.</p>

<p><a name="section186" id="section186"></a>
§ <b>186.</b> The <b>three-foot trochaic line</b>, both with feminine<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_247" id="Pg_247" title="247"></a> and with
masculine endings, has been discussed in previous sections (§§ <a href="#section182">182&ndash;3</a>) so
far as it is derived from seven- and six-foot verse. It may also be
derived from the six-foot metre through the breaking up of the line by
means of leonine rhyme, as in the following rhyming couplets:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Áge, I dó abhór thee,</div>
    <div class="line">Yóuth, I dó adóre thee;</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p><a name="section187" id="section187"></a>
§ <b>187. Two-foot trochaic lines</b> generally occur among longer lines of
anisometrical stanzas; but we also find them now and then without longer

regarded as four-foot lines broken up by leonine rhyme, we have in

§ <b>188. One-foot trochaic lines</b> seem only to occur among longer
verses in regular stanzas, as e.g. in a stanza of Addison’s opera
<cite>Rosamund</cite> (<span class="fakesc">I.</span> ii. 38):</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>We even find sometimes a line consisting of a single (of course
accented) syllable in Swinburne, as e.g. in his poem<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_248" id="Pg_248" title="248"></a> in trochaic verse,
<cite>A Dead Friend</cite> (<cite>A Century of Roundels</cite>, pp. 12&ndash;19):</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>It is common to all these trochaic metres that their structure,
especially that of the longer ones, is (except for the varying caesura)
very regular, and that they have only very few rhythmical licences,
chiefly slight slurring.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<span class="subtitle">IAMBIC-ANAPAESTIC AND TROCHAIC-DACTYLIC
  METRES</span></h3>

<p><a name="section189" id="section189"></a>
§ <b>189.</b> The <b>iambic-anapaestic rhythm</b> has been touched on before in
connexion with the four-stressed verse (cf. § <a href="#section72">72</a>) which was developed
from the alliterative long line, and which at the end of the Middle
English and in the beginning of the Modern English period, under the
growing influence of the even-beat metres, had assumed more or less
regular iambic-anapaestic character.</p>

<p>When during the same period a definitive separation of the rising and
falling rhythms took place, the even-measured rhythm of this
four-stressed modern metre became more conspicuous and was made up
frequently, although not always, of a regular series of
iambic-anapaestic measures. It was thus differentiated still more
distinctly from the uneven-beat Old and Middle English long line, the
character of which mainly rested on the four well-marked beats only. It
deserves notice further that it was not until the Modern English period
that the rest of the iambic-anapaestic and trochaic-dactylic metres (the
eight-, seven-, six-, five-, four-, three-, and two-foot verses) were
imitated from the then common corresponding iambic rhythms.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century Puttenham quotes four-foot dactylics, and in
his time the dactylic hexameter had already been imitated in English.
But most of the other trisyllabic rising and falling metres, except the
Septenary, occur first in English poetry at the end of the eighteenth
and during the course of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>It must also be noted that in many cases, especially in the eight-,
four-, and two-foot verses of this kind (i.e. in those metres that are
connected with the old four-stressed verse), the rising and falling
rhythms are not strictly separated, but frequently intermingle and even
supplement one another.</p>

<h4>I. Iambic-anapaestic Metres.</h4>

<p><a name="section190" id="section190"></a>
§ <b>190. Eight-foot iambic-anapaestic verses</b> rhyming in long lines are
very rare, but appear in the following four-lined stanza of four-foot
verses by Burns, <cite>The Chevalier’s Lament</cite> (p. 343):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">The smáll birds rejóice in the gr<span class="normal">ée</span>n l<span class="normal">ea</span>ves retúrning,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">The múrmuring stréamlet winds cléar thro’ the vále;</div>

    <div class="line indent2">And wíld scatter’d  cówslips bedéck the gr<span class="normal">ee</span>n d<span class="normal">á</span>le.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In this metre each of the two periods begins with an iambic measure and
then passes into anapaests, the feminine ending of the first (or third)
line and the iambic beginning of the second (or fourth) forming together
an anapaest.</p>

<p>In a poem by Swinburne (<cite>Poems</cite>, ii. 144) four-foot anapaestic and
dactylic lines alternate so as to form anapaestic periods:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">For a dáy and a níght Love sáng to us, pláyed with us,</div>
    <div class="line">Fólded us róund from the dárk and the líght, <span class="normal">&amp;c.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>For other less correct specimens of such combinations of verse cf.
<cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §225.</p>

<p><a name="section191" id="section191"></a>
§ <b>191. The seven-foot iambic-anapaestic verse</b> would seem to be of
rare occurrence except in the most recent period; in long lines and
masculine rhymes it has been used by Swinburne, as e.g. in <cite>The Death of
Richard Wagner</cite>;<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> we quote the middle stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">As a vísion of héaven from the hóllows of ócean, | that nóne but a gód might sée,</div>
    <div class="line">Rose óut of the sílence of thíngs unknówn | of a présence, a fórm, a míght,</div>
    <div class="line">And we héard as a próphet that h<span class="normal">éa</span>rs G<span class="normal">o</span>d’s méssage | agáinst him, and máy not flée.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The occurrence of an iambus or a spondee at the end and sometimes in the
middle of the verse is remarkable, as well as the arbitrary treatment of
the caesura, which does not, as in the iambic Septenary verse, always
come after the fourth foot (as in the second line), but sometimes in
other places; in the first and third lines, for instance, there is a
feminine caesura in the fifth foot.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_251" id="Pg_251" title="251"></a></p>

<p>More often this Septenary metre occurs in short lines (and therefore
with fixed masculine caesura). In this form it appears as early as the
seventeenth century in a poem by the Earl of Dorset, <cite>To Chloris</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Ah! Chlóris, ’tis tíme to disárm your bright éyes,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">And lay bý those térrible glánces;</div>
    <div class="line">We líve in an áge that’s more cívil and wíse,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Than to fóllow the rúles of románces.</div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="attribution">Poets, vii. 513.</div>

<p>Another specimen of the same rhythm, very artistically handled (cf.
<cite>Metrik</cite>, i, § 226) is Charles Wolfe’s well-known poem <cite>The Burial of
Sir John Moore</cite>. The same metre also occurs with masculine rhymes.</p>

<p><a name="section192" id="section192"></a>
§ <b>192.</b> The <b>six-foot iambic-anapaestic verse</b> sometimes occurs in
Modern English poets, as Tennyson, <cite>The Grandmother</cite>, <cite>Maud</cite>, &amp;c.,
Robert Browning, <cite>Abt Vogler</cite>, Mrs. Browning, <cite>Confessions</cite>, Swinburne,
<cite>Hymn to Proserpine</cite>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>We quote the following verses from Tennyson’s <cite>Maud</cite> to illustrate this
metre, which, however, in consequence of the fluctuating proportion of
iambic and anapaestic measures occurring in it is handled very
differently by different poets (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 227):</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Did he flíng himself dówn? who knóws? | for a vást speculátion had fáil’d,</div>
    <div class="line">And éver he mútter’d  and mádden’d, | and éver wánn’d  with despáir,</div>
    <div class="line">And óut he wálk’d  when the wínd | like a bróken wórldling wáil’d,</div>
    <div class="line">And the flýing góld of the rúin’d  wóodlands | dróve thro’ the áir.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The caesura is sometimes masculine after the third foot (as in lines 1
and 3), sometimes feminine in the fourth (line 2) or the fifth (line 4);
so that its position is quite indeterminate. The rhymes are mostly
masculine, but feminine rhymes are also met with, as e.g. in Mrs.
Browning’s <cite>Confessions</cite>. Swinburne’s verses are printed in long lines,
it is true, but they are broken into short lines by inserted masculine
and feminine rhymes.</p>

<p><a name="section193" id="section193"></a>
§ <b>193.</b> The <b>five-foot iambic-anapaestic verse</b> likewise does not occur
till recent times, and is chiefly used by the poets just mentioned.
Rhymed in couplets it occurs in Mrs. Browning’s <cite>The Daughters of
Pandarus</cite>, Version II (vol. iv, p. 200):</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_252" id="Pg_252" title="252"></a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">So the stórms bore the dáughters of Pándarus | óut into thráll&mdash;</div>
    <div class="line">The góds slew their párents; | the órphans were léft in the háll.</div>
    <div class="line">And there cáme, to féed their young líves, Aphrodíte divíne,</div>
    <div class="line">With the íncense, the swéet-tasting hóney, the swéet-smelling wíne.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The rhythm is here almost entirely anapaestic; the caesura occurs in the
most diverse places and may be either masculine or feminine. The ending
of the line is masculine throughout, as well as in Robert Browning’s
<cite>Saul</cite> (iii. 146&ndash;96), but with many run-on lines.</p>

<p>In Swinburne’s <cite>A Word from the Psalmist</cite> (<cite>A Mids. Holiday</cite>, p. 176) we
have another treatment of this metre. As a rule the line begins with an
anapaest, and continues in pure iambic rhythm:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">But a lóuder | thán the Chúrch’s écho | thúnders</div>
    <div class="line indent2">In the éars of mén | who máy not chóose but héar;</div>
    <div class="line">And the héart in hím | that héars it léaps and wónders,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">With triúmphant hópe | astónished, ór with féar.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In other examples it has an iambic or spondaic rhythm at the beginning
and end, with an anapaestic part in the middle, as in <cite>The Seaboard</cite>
(ib., p. 3) by the same poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">The séa is at ébb, | and the sóund of her útmost wórd,</div>
    <div class="line">Is sóft as the l<span class="normal">éa</span>st w<span class="normal">a</span>ve’s lápse | in a stíll sm<span class="normal">a</span>ll r<span class="normal">éa</span>ch.</div>

    <div class="line">Where éarth gives éar | to the méssage that áll days préach.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In <cite>A Century of Roundels</cite>, p. 1, &amp;c., Swinburne uses this metre, which
also occurs in Tennyson’s <cite>Maud</cite>, with feminine and masculine endings
alternately.</p>

<p><a name="section194" id="section194"></a>
§ <b>194.</b> The <b>four-foot iambic-anapaestic verse</b> is essentially
identical with the four-stressed verse treated of above (§ <a href="#section72">72</a>), except
that it has assumed a still more regular, even-beat rhythm in modern
times; generally it begins with an iambus and anapaests follow, as in
the stanza quoted from Burns (§ <a href="#section190">190</a>). Occasionally this metre has an
almost entirely anapaestic structure; as e.g. in Moore, <cite>In the Morning
of Life</cite>:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_253" id="Pg_253" title="253"></a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">In the mórning of lífe, | when its cáres are unknówn,</div>

    <div class="line indent2">And the líght that surróunds us | is áll from withín.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In other examples the rhythm is chiefly iambic, intermingled with
occasional anapaests; as e.g. in Moore’s <cite>You Remember Ellen</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">You remémber Éllen, | our hámlet’s príde</div>
      How méekly she bléssed | her húmble lót,</div>

      And lóve was the líght | of her lówly cót.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Verses like these, which in their structure recall the earlier
four-stressed verses, frequently occur (see §§ <a href="#section72">72</a>, <a href="#section132">132</a>) mixed with
four-foot verses of a somewhat freer build in the narrative poems of
Coleridge, Scott, and Byron.</p>

<p><a name="section195" id="section195"></a>
§ <b>195.</b> The <b>three-foot iambic-anapaestic verse</b> took its origin by
analogy to the corresponding four-foot line, or perhaps to the two-foot
line derived from it by inserted rhymes; it occurs as early as Tusser,
<cite>Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry</cite> (cf. Guest, ii, p. 251):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">What lóokest thou hérein to háve?</div>
    <div class="line">Fíne vérses thy fáncy to pléase?</div>
    <div class="line">Of mány my bétters that cráve;</div>
    <div class="line">Look nóthing but rúdeness in thése.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>We have the same metre (two anapaests following the first iambic
measure) in Rowe, Shenstone, Moore, and others, sometimes with alternate
masculine and feminine rhymes.</p>

<p><a name="section196" id="section196"></a>
§ <b>196.</b> The <b>two-foot iambic-anapaestic verse</b> sprang from the
breaking-up of the corresponding four-foot (or four-stressed) line by
inserted or leonine rhyme, as we find it even in the Middle English
bob-wheel stanzas; in Modern English we have it in Tusser for the first
time:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Ill húsbandry brággeth</div>
    <div class="line">To gó with the bést,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_254" id="Pg_254" title="254"></a></p>

<p>This metre is used by Gay, Goldsmith, Scott, Moore, Longfellow, Robert
Browning, and others; it is also found with an anapaest following the
first iambic measure, and either with masculine and feminine rhymes
alternately, as in the example quoted above, or (as is most usual) with
these rhymes in indiscriminate succession.</p>

<p><a name="section197" id="section197"></a>
§ <b>197.</b> The <b>one-foot iambic-anapaestic verse</b> occasionally occurs in
the Middle English bob-wheel stanzas. In Modern English we find it only
as an element in anisometrical stanzas, as e.g. in the following
half-stanza of Shelley’s <cite>Autumn</cite> (iii. 65):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

  </div>
</div>

<p>In Shakespeare’s <cite>Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite>, <span class="fakesc">III.</span> ii. 448&ndash;63
(apart from the four-foot trochaic end-lines of the half-stanzas),
we also have such verses apparently; the iambic-anapaestic
character being clearly shown by a couplet like the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">When thou wákest,</div>
    <div class="line">Thou tákest.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>


<h4>II. Trochaic-dactylic Metres</h4>

<p><a name="section198" id="section198"></a>
§ <b>198.</b> These are much rarer than the iambic-anapaestic metres.
Specimens of all of them are quoted, but some are only theoretical
examples invented by, and repeated from, English or American metrists.</p>

<p>Theoretically the acatalectic dactylic verse in its rhymed form ought
always to have trisyllabic or at least feminine caesura and ending. As a
fact, however, these metres have just as frequently or perhaps more
frequently masculine caesuras and rhymes.</p>

<p>The <b>eight-foot trochaic-dactylic verse</b>, alternating occasionally with
iambic-anapaestic lines, occurs in Longfellow’s <cite>The Golden Legend</cite>,
<span class="locked">iv:<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></span></p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>There are, as appears from this specimen, a great many licences in these
verses; the caesura, mostly in the fourth foot, is masculine in lines 1,
5, 6, feminine in 2; so that the second half of the line has an
iambic-anapaestic rhythm. Besides this most of the lines have secondary
caesuras in different places of the verse; iambic-anapaestic verses
(like 3, 4, 6) are decidedly in the minority. The rhymes are both
feminine and masculine, but there is no regular alternation between
them, as might be supposed from the above short specimen.</p>

<p><a name="section199" id="section199"></a>
§ <b>199.</b> The form of the <b>seven-foot trochaic-dactylic verse</b> may be
illustrated by the following theoretical specimen, quoted from <cite>The
Grammar of English Grammars</cite> (p. 880), by Goold Brown:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

  </div>
</div>

<p>Verses of this form with masculine endings printed in short lines occur
in a song by Burns (p. 217):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

§ <b>200.</b> The <b>six-foot trochaic-dactylic verse</b> may be illus<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_256" id="Pg_256" title="256"></a>trated by a
theoretical specimen from Goold Brown (p. 880), which is strictly
dactylic, with inserted rhymes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>

<p>Generally this metre is combined with iambic-anapaestic verses, as e.g.
in Mrs. Browning’s <cite>Confessions</cite> (iii. 60) mentioned above, § <a href="#section192">192</a>, which
is, for the greatest part, written in this form:</p>

§ <b>201.</b> The <b>five-foot trochaic-dactylic verse</b> occurs now and then in

<p>The verses are trochaic with two dactyls at the beginning. The caesura

<h3>CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="subtitle">NON-STROPHIC, ANISOMETRICAL COMBINATIONS
  OF RHYMED VERSE</span></h3>

<p><a name="section206" id="section206"></a>
§ <b>206.</b> Non-strophic anisometrical combinations of rhymed verse consist
of lines of different metres, rhyming in pairs, and recurring in a
definite order of succession. One of these combinations, known as the
<b>Poulter’s Measure</b> (Alexandrine + Septenary), already occurs in the
Middle English Period (cf. § <a href="#section146">146</a>) and has remained in use down to the
present day. It was at one time extremely popular, and has in the Modern
English Period been imitated in other metres.</p>

<p>The most common variety of this metre is that in which the verses have
an iambic-anapaestic rhythm; they are usually printed in short lines, as
e.g. in a poem by Charles Kingsley:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">When Í was a gréenhorn and yóung,</div>
    <div class="line">   And wánted to bé and to dó,</div>
    <div class="line"> I púzzled my bráins about chóosing my líne,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">   Till I fóund out the wáy that things gó.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Before his time Burns had composed a poem in the same metre, <cite>Here’s a
Health to them that’s awa</cite> (p. 245); and at the end of the seventeenth
century Philips (<cite>Poets</cite>, vi. 560) wrote a <cite>Bacchanalian Song</cite> in
similar verses.</p>

<p>In the same metre are the <cite>Nonsense Rhymes</cite> by Edward Lear,<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> as well
as many other quatrains of a similar kind, the humour of which is often
somewhat coarse.</p>

<p>An unusual sub-species of this metre, consisting of trochaic verses,
occurs only very rarely in Leigh Hunt, e.g. in <cite>Wealth and Womanhood</cite>
(p. 277):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Háve you séen an héiress ín her jéwels móunted,</div>
    <div class="line"> Tíll her wéalth and shé seem’d  óne, ánd she míght be cóunted?</div>
    <div class="line"> Háve you séen a bósom wíth one róse betwíxt it?</div>
    <div class="line"> And díd you márk the gráteful blúsh, whén the brídegroom fíx’d  it?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_260" id="Pg_260" title="260"></a></p>

<p><a name="section207" id="section207"></a>
§ <b>207.</b> Other anisometrical combinations consist of a five-foot line
followed by one consisting of four, three, or two feet. This form we
find pretty often; Ben Jonson, e.g., uses it (five + four feet) in his
translation of Horace, <cite>Odes</cite> v. 11 (<cite>Poets</cite>, iv. 596):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Háppy is hé, that fróm all búsiness cléar,</div>

    <div class="line">Nor sóldier-líke, stárted with róugh alárms,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Nor dréads the séa’s enráged hárms, <span class="normal">&amp;c.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>He used the reverse order in <cite>Odes</cite> iv. 1. In Wordsworth’s poem <cite>The
Gipsies</cite> (iv. 68) we have the couplets: <em>a a<sub>5</sub> b b<sub>4</sub> c c<sub>5</sub> d d<sub>4</sub></em>, &amp;c., but
not divided into stanzas.</p>

<p>Five- and three-foot lines <em>a<sub>5</sub> a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub> d<sub>5</sub> d<sub>3</sub></em>, &amp;c., occur in Ben
Jonson, <cite>The Forest, <span class="fakesc">XI.</span> Epode</cite> (<cite>Poets</cite>, vi, pp. 555&ndash;6); and with
reverse order (<em>a<sub>3</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub></em>, &amp;c.) in his <cite>Epigrams</cite> (<cite>Poets</cite>, iv.
546).</p>

<p>The combination of five- and two-foot lines seems to occur in modern
poets only; e.g. in W. S. Landor, <cite>Miscellanies</cite>, clxxv (ii. 649):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Néver may stórm thy péaceful bósom véx,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>With crossed rhymes (feminine and masculine rhymes, alternately) this
combination occurs in Mrs. Browning, <cite>A Drama of Exile</cite> (i. 12), where
the scheme is <em>a ~<sub>5</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a ~<sub>5</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c ~<sub>5</sub> d<sub>2</sub> c ~<sub>5</sub> d<sub>2</sub></em>, and in R. Browning, <cite>A
Grammarian’s Funeral</cite> (iv. 270), the formula being <em>a<sub>5</sub> b ~<sub>2</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b ~<sub>2</sub> c<sub>5</sub> d
~<sub>2</sub> c<sub>5</sub> d ~<sub>2</sub></em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="section208" id="section208"></a>
§ <b>208.</b> Combinations of four- and two-foot lines (masculine and
feminine endings) occur in Ben Jonson, <cite>Epigrams</cite>, cxx (<cite>Poets</cite>, iv.
545); iambic and anapaestic verses similarly combined in R. Browning,
<cite>Prospice</cite>, vi. 152.</p>

<p>In the same poet we have three- and two-foot iambic-anapaestic lines
with the formula <em>a ~<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c ~<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub> d ~<sub>3</sub> e<sub>2</sub> f ~<sub>3</sub> e<sub>2</sub></em>; in <cite>The Englishman
in Italy</cite> (iv. 186):</p>

<p>In Mrs. Browning we find this metre, which might be taken also as
five-foot iambic-anapaestic couplets, broken up by internal rhyme
(according to the formula <em>a ~<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a ~<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c ~<sub>3</sub> d<sub>2</sub> c ~<sub>3</sub> d<sub>2</sub></em>, &amp;c.) in <cite>A

<h3>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<span class="subtitle">IMITATIONS OF CLASSICAL FORMS OF VERSE
  AND STANZA</span></h3>

<p><a name="section209" id="section209"></a>
§ <b>209. The English hexameter.</b> Of all imitations of classical metres
in English the best known and most popular is the hexameter. In the
history of its development we have to distinguish two epochs&mdash;that of
the first and somewhat grotesque attempts to introduce it into English
poetry in the second half of the sixteenth century, and that of its
revival in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p>

<p>The hexameter was introduced into English poetry by Gabriel Harvey
(1545&ndash;1630), who, in his <cite>Encomium Lauri</cite>, attempted to imitate the
quantitative classic verse in the accentual English language, paying
attention as much as possible to the quantity of the English words.</p>

<p>Sir Philip Sidney followed with some poetical portions of his <cite>Arcadia</cite>
written in this metre; Stanyhurst (1545&ndash;1618) translated the first four
books of Virgil in quantitative hexameters; in 1591 Abraham Fraunce
translated Virgil’s <cite>Alexis</cite>, and William Webbe, the metrist, turned
into English the <cite>Georgics</cite> and two eclogues of the same poet, also in
quantitative hexameters; but all these efforts had little success on
account of the unfitness of English for quantitative treatment. Robert
Greene also employed this metre in some of his minor poems, but followed
the accentual system; on this account he was more successful, but he
found no imitators, and during the latter part of the seventeenth
century the metre fell altogether into disuse.</p>

<p>In one isolated case about the middle of the eighteenth century it was
revived by an anonymous translator of Virgil’s first and fourth
eclogues. But English hexameters did not begin to come into favour again
before the close of the eighteenth century, when the influence of the
study of German poetry began to make itself felt. Parts of Klopstock’s
<cite>Messiah</cite> were translated by William Taylor (1765&ndash;1836) in the metre of
the original. He also turned several passages of Ossian into hexameters
(published in June, 1796, in the <cite>Monthly<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_263" id="Pg_263" title="263"></a> Magazine</cite>), and maintained
that the hexameter, modified after the German fashion by the
substitution of the accentual for the quantitative principle and the use
of trochees instead of spondees, could be used with as good effect in
English as in German. About the same time, Coleridge used the hexameter
in some of his minor poems, <cite>Hymn to the Earth</cite>, <cite>Mahomet</cite>, &amp;c., and
Southey chose this form for his longer poem, <cite>A Vision of Judgement</cite>.</p>

<p>But it was not till the middle of the nineteenth century that the
English hexameter came into somewhat more extensive use. It was at first
chiefly employed in translations from the German. Goethe’s <cite>Hermann und
Dorothea</cite> has been translated five times at least (for the first time by
Cochrane, Oxford, 1850). The metre has also been employed in
translations of classical poetry, especially Homer and Virgil, and in
original poems, none of which, however, have attained general popularity
except those by Longfellow, especially his <cite>Evangeline</cite> and <cite>The
Courtship of Miles Standish</cite></p>

<p><a name="section210" id="section210"></a>
§ <b>210.</b> The hexameter is a six-foot catalectic verse theoretically
consisting of five successive dactyls and a trochee. But the greatest
rhythmical variety is given to this verse by the rule which allows a
spondee to be used instead of any of the dactyls; in the fifth foot,
however, this rarely occurs. In the sixth foot, moreover, the spondee is
admissible instead of the trochee. The structure of the verse may thus
be expressed by the following formula:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="scansion">–́⏑͞⏑–́⏑͞⏑–́⏑͞⏑–́⏑͞⏑–́⏑⏑–́⏑̄</span>.</p>

<p>The main difficulty in imitating this metre in English is caused by
the large number of monosyllabic words in the English language, and
especially by its lack of words with a spondaic measurement.</p>

<p>Some recent attempts to imitate the hexameter in English according
to the principles of quantity have been altogether unsuccessful, as
e.g. Cayley’s (<cite>Transactions of the Philological Society</cite>, 1862&ndash;3,
Part i, pp. 67&ndash;85). Matthew Arnold’s method too proved impracticable
(<cite>On Translating Homer</cite>, London, 1862); he attempted and recommended
the regulation of the rhythm of the verse by the accent and at the
same time sought not to neglect the quantity altogether. But the only
successful method of adapting the hexameter to English use is that
adopted by William Taylor, who followed the example of the<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_264" id="Pg_264" title="264"></a> Germans
in observing only the accentual system and substituting the accentual
trochee for the spondee. Sir John Herschel in his translation of Homer
and Longfellow in his original poems have done the same.</p>

<p>Even with these modifications a certain harshness now and then is
inevitable in hexameters both in German and particularly in English,
where many lines occur consisting nearly throughout of monosyllables
only, as e.g. the following lines from Longfellow’s <cite>Evangeline</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Whíte as the snów were his lócks, and his chéeks as brówn as the óak-leaves.</div>
    <div class="line">Ánd the great séal of the láw  was sét like a sún on a márgin.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Other passages, however, prove the English hexameter to be as capable
of harmony as the German if treated in this way; cf. e.g. the
introductory verses of the same <span class="locked">poem:<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p><a name="section211" id="section211"></a>
§ <b>211.</b> Besides these repeated attempts to naturalize the hexameter in
English, many other kinds of classical verses and stanzas have been
imitated in English literature from the middle of the sixteenth and
afterwards during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Among these
the <b>Elegiac</b> verse of the ancients (hexameter alternating with
pentameter) was attempted by Sidney in his <cite>Arcadia</cite>. Of more modern
experiments in accordance with the accentual principle, Coleridge’s
translation of Schiller’s well-known distich may be quoted:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_265" id="Pg_265" title="265"></a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Ín the hexámeter ríses the fóuntains sílvery cólumn,</div>
    <div class="line">Ín the pentámeter áye fálling in mélody báck.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Swinburne, among others, has written his <cite>Hesperia</cite> (<cite>Poems and
Ballads</cite>, i, 1868, p. 200) in rhymed verses of this kind:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Óut of the gólden remóte wild wést, where the séa without shóre is,</div>
    <div class="line">Fúll of the súnset, and sád, if at áll, with the fúllness of jóy,</div>
    <div class="line">As a wínd sets ín with the áutumn that blóws from the région of stóries,</div>
    <div class="line">Blóws from a pérfume of sóngs and of mémories belóved fróm a bóy.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The third line is remarkable for its anacrusis, which occasionally
occurs also in other English hexameters.</p>

<p>Sidney in his <cite>Arcadia</cite>, p. 229 (333, xxxvii), also tried the <b>minor
Asclepiad</b>, which has the following scheme:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="scansion">–́–̆–́⏑⏑–́|–́⏑⏑–́⏑–̆</span>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>In his <cite>Arcadia</cite>, p. 228 (232, xxxvi), Sidney used the <b>Phaleuciac</b>
verse of eleven syllables in stanzas of six lines marked by the
recurrence of a refrain. The rhythm is the same as in the
<b>Hendecasyllabics</b> of modern poets, in the following lines of
Swinburne (<cite>Poems</cite>, i. 233):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

  </div>
</div>

<p>The same metre was inaccurately imitated by Coleridge (p. 252) who put a
dactyl in the first foot:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

<p>Finally, the <b>rhymed Choriambics</b> may be mentioned, used
also by Swinburne (<cite>Poems</cite>, ii. 141&ndash;3):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>

<p><a name="section212" id="section212"></a>
§ <b>212.</b> Among the <b>classical stanzas</b>, which may appropriately be
discussed in this connexion, the <b>Sapphic metre</b> deserves the first
place, as it has been imitated pretty often; its scheme is as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line"><span class="scansion">–́⏑–––́|⏑⏑–⏑––</span></div>
    <div class="line"><span class="scansion">–́⏑–––́|⏑⏑–⏑––</span></div>

    <div class="line indent10"><span class="scansion">–́⏑⏑––</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It is certainly not an easy task to write in this form of stanza, as
it is rather difficult in English to imitate feet of three or even two
long syllables (Molossus and Spondee). Yet it has been used by several
poets, as by Sidney and his contemporary, the metrist William Webbe; in
the eighteenth century by Dr. Watts, Cowper, and Southey (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>,
ii, § 253); and in later times by Swinburne, from whose <cite>Poems and
Ballads</cite> a specimen may be quoted:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Áll the nī́ght slēep cā́me not upṓn my ḗyelids,</div>

    <div class="line indent10">Stṓod and behḗld me.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Of other kinds of classical verses and stanzas the <b>Alcaic metre</b> has
occasionally been imitated, e.g. by Tennyson. The scheme of the Latin
original is as follows:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_267" id="Pg_267" title="267"></a></p>

<p>Tennyson’s poem is an <cite>Ode to Milton</cite> (p. 281):</p>

<p>There are besides in Sidney’s <cite>Arcadia</cite>, pp. 227 (232, xxxv) and 533,
<b>Anacreontic stanzas</b> of varying length, consisting of 3&ndash;11 verses and
constructed in this way:</p>

§ <b>213.</b> In connexion with these imitations of classical verses and
stanzas without rhyme some other forms should be mentioned which took
their rise from an attempt to get rid of end-rhyme. Orm was the first
to make the experiment in his rhymeless Septenary, but he found no
followers in the Middle English period; Surrey, several centuries
later, on the other hand, did achieve success with his blank verse.
In the beginning of the seventeenth century Thomas Campion, in his
<cite>Observations on the Arte of English Poesy</cite> (London, 1602), tried
to introduce certain kinds of rhymeless verses and stanzas, mostly
trochaic; e.g. trochaic verses of three measures (with masculine
endings) and of five measures (with feminine endings); distichs
consisting of one five-foot iambic and one six-foot trochaic verse
(both masculine); then a free imitation of the Sapphic metre and
other kinds of rhymeless stanzas, quoted and discussed in <cite>Metrik</cite>,
ii, § 254. But these early and isolated attempts need not engage our
attention in this place, as they had probably no influence on similar
experiments of later poets.</p>

<p>In Milton, e.g., we find a stanza corresponding to the formula <em>a
b<sub>5</sub> c d<sub>3</sub></em>, in his imitation of the fifth Ode of Horace, Book I, used
also by Collins, <cite>Ode to Evening</cite> (<cite>Poets</cite>, ix. 526):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">If áught of oáten stóp or pástoral sóng</div>
    <div class="line">May hópe, chast Éve, to soóthe thy módest éar</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Like thý own sólemn spríngs</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Thy spríngs and dýing gáles.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Southey uses the same stanza (ii. 145); to him we owe several other
rhymeless stanzas of the form <em>a b<sub>4</sub> c d<sub>3</sub></em> (ii. 212), <em>a<sub>3</sub> b c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub></em>
(ii. 210) (both of anapaestic verses), <em>a b c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub></em> (ii. 148), <a class="pagenum" name="Pg_268" id="Pg_268" title="268"></a><em>a<sub>3</sub> b
c<sub>5</sub> d<sub>3</sub></em> (ii. 159), <em>a<sub>4</sub> b c<sub>3</sub> d<sub>5</sub></em> (ii. 182), <em>a b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub> d<sub>3</sub></em> (ii. 187),
<em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub> d<sub>3</sub></em> (ii. 189); all consisting of iambic verses.</p>

<p>The same poet also uses a stanza of five iambic lines of the form
<em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> d e<sub>3</sub></em> (iii. 255), and another of the form <em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub> d<sub>4</sub> e<sub>3</sub></em>
in his ode <cite>The Battle of Algiers</cite> (iii. 253):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

    <div class="line indent2">Like séa-birds ón the súnny máin,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Rock ídly ín the pórt.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A stanza of similar construction (formula <em>a b c<sub>5</sub> d e<sub>3</sub></em> is used
by Mrs. Browning in <cite>The Measure</cite> (iii. 114).</p>

<p>Various isometrical and anisometrical stanzas of this kind occur in
Lord Lytton’s <cite>Lost Tales of Miletus</cite>; one of these consists of three
of Coleridge’s Hendecasyllabics, followed by one masculine verse of
similar form, and has the formula <em>a ~ b ~ c ~ d<sub>5</sub></em>; it is used, e.g.,
in <cite>Cydippe</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Fáirest and hárdiest óf the yóuths in Céos</div>
    <div class="line">Flóurish’d  Acóntius frée from lóve’s sweet tróuble,</div>

    <div class="line indent2">Chánting the góddess óf the silver bów.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In another stanza used in <cite>The Wife of Miletus</cite> an ordinary masculine
blank verse alternates with a Hendecasyllabic; a third of the form <em>a b
c d<sub>4</sub></em> consists of trochaic verses.</p>

<p>Other stanzas of ordinary five- and three-foot verses used by him in
the <cite>Lost Tales</cite> have the formulas <em>a b<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub> d<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a b c<sub>5</sub> d<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a ~ b
~<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub> d<sub>5</sub></em>.</p>

<p>In another stanza (<cite>Corinna</cite>), constructed after the formula
<em>a b<sub>4</sub> c d<sub>3</sub></em>, a dactylic rhythm prevails:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Gláucon of Lésbos, the són of Euphórion,</div>
    <div class="line">Búrned for Corinna, the blúe-eyed Milésian.</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Nor móther nor fáther hád she;</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Béauty and wéalth had the órphan.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Stanzas of a similar kind consisting of trochaic verses are used by
Longfellow; one of the form <em>a<sub>3</sub> b c<sub>4</sub> d ~<sub>2</sub></em> in <cite>To an old Danish Song
Book</cite>, and another which corresponds to the formula <em>a b<sub>5</sub> c<sub>2</sub> d<sub>5</sub></em> in
<cite>The Golden Mile-Stone</cite>.</p>

<p>Iambic-anapaestic verses of two stresses and feminine ending are found
in Longfellow’s poem <cite>The Men of Nidaros</cite> (p. 579); the arrangement into
stanzas of six lines being marked only by<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_269" id="Pg_269" title="269"></a> the syntactical order, in the
same way as in Southey’s poem <cite>The Soldier’s Wife</cite> (ii. 140), in which,
too, four-foot dactylic verses are combined in stanzas of three lines.
Two-foot dactylic and dactylic-trochaic verses of a similar structure to
those mentioned in Book I, § <a href="#section73">73</a>, are joined to rhymeless stanzas of five
lines (the first four have feminine endings, the last a masculine one)
by Matthew Arnold in his poem <cite>Consolation</cite> (p. 50). Stanzas of five
iambic verses of three and five measures, corresponding to the formula
<em>a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub> d<sub>5</sub> e<sub>3</sub></em> occur in his poem <cite>Growing Old</cite> (p. 527). In Charles
Lamb’s well-known poem, <cite>The Old Familiar Faces</cite>, written in stanzas of
three lines, consisting of five-foot verses with feminine endings, the
division into stanzas is marked by a refrain at the end of each stanza.
For examples of these different kinds of verses the reader is referred
to the author’s <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 255&ndash;8.</p>

<p>In conclusion it may be mentioned that many of the irregular, so-called
Pindaric Odes (cf. Book II, chap. <a href="#Pg_363">viii</a>) are likewise written in
rhymeless anisometrical stanzas.</p>

<h2>BOOK II. THE STRUCTURE OF STANZAS</h2>

<h2>PART I</h2>




<h3>CHAPTER I. DEFINITIONS<br />

<span class="subtitle">STANZA, RHYME, VARIETIES OF RHYME</span></h3>

<p><a name="section214" id="section214"></a>
§ <b>214.</b> The strophe in ancient poetry, and the stanza in mediaeval and
modern analogues and derivatives of that poetic form, are combinations
of single lines into a unity of which the lines are the parts. The word
<em>strophe</em><a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> in its literal sense means a turning, and originally
denoted the return of the song to the melody with which it began. The
melody, which is a series of musical sounds arranged in accordance with
the laws of rhythm and modulation, has in poetry its counterpart in a
parallel series of significant sounds or words arranged according to the
laws of rhythm; and the melodic termination of the musical series has
its analogue in the logical completion of the thought. But within the
stanza itself again there are well-marked resting places, divisions
closely connected with the periods or sentences of which the stanza is
made up. The periods are built up of rhythmical sequences which are
combinations of single feet, dominated by a rhythmical main accent. In
shorter lines the end of the rhythmical sequence as a rule coincides
with the end of the verse; but if the line is of some length it
generally contains two or even more rhythmical sequences.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> The
essential constituents of the stanza are the lines; and the structure of
the stanzas connected together to make up a poem is in classical as well
as in mediaeval and modern poetry subject to the rule that<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_271" id="Pg_271" title="271"></a> the lines of
each stanza of the poem must resemble those of the other stanzas in
number, length (i.e. the number of feet or measures), rhythmical
structure, and arrangement. (This rule, however, is not without
exceptions in modern poetry.) In the versification of the ancients it
was sufficient for the construction of a strophic poem that its verses
should be combined in a certain number of groups which resembled each
other in these respects. In modern poetry, also, such an arrangement of
the verses may be sufficient for the construction of stanzas; but this
is only exceptionally the case, and, as a rule, only in imitation of the
classic metrical forms (cf. §§ <a href="#section212">212&ndash;13</a>). The stanza, as it is found in
the mediaeval and modern poetry of the nations of western Europe,
exhibits an additional structural element of the greatest importance,
viz. the connexion of the single lines of the stanza by end-rhyme; and
with regard to this a rule analogous to the previously mentioned law
regarding the equality in number and nature of verses forming a stanza
holds good, viz. that the arrangement of the rhymes which link the
verses together to form stanzas, must be the same in all the stanzas of
a poem.</p>

<p><a name="section215" id="section215"></a>
§ <b>215.</b> Of the three chief kinds of rhyme, in its widest sense
(mentioned § <a href="#section10">10</a>), i.e. alliteration, assonance, and end-rhyme, only the
last need be taken into consideration here. There are, indeed, some
poems in Old English in which end-rhyme is used consciously and
intentionally (see §§ <a href="#section40">40&ndash;1</a>), but it was never used in that period for
the construction of stanzas. This took place first in Middle English
under the influence and after the model of the Low Latin and the Romanic
lyrics.</p>

<p>The influence of the Low Latin lyrical and hymnodic poetry on the Old
English stanzas is easily explicable from the position of the Latin
language as the international tongue of the church and of learning
during the Middle Ages. The influence of the lyrical forms of Provence
and of Northern France on Middle English poetry was rendered possible by
various circumstances. In the first place, during the crusades the
nations of Western Europe frequently came into close contact with each
other. A more important factor, however, was the Norman Conquest, in
consequence of which the Norman-French language during a considerable
time predominated in the British Isles and acted as a channel of
communication of literature with the continent. One historical event
deserves in this connexion special mention&mdash;the marriage in the year
1152 of Henry, Duke of Normandy (who came to the throne of England in
1154), and Eleonore of<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_272" id="Pg_272" title="272"></a> Poitou, widow of Louis VII of France; in her
train Bernard de Ventadorn, the troubadour, came to England, whither
many other poets and minstrels soon followed him, both in the reign of
Henry and of his successor Richard Coeur de Lion, who himself composed
songs in the Provençal and in the French language. The effect of the
spread of songs like these in Provençal and French in England was to
give a stimulus and add new forms to the native lyrical poetry which was
gradually reviving. At first indeed the somewhat complicated strophic
forms of the Provençal and Northern French lyrics did not greatly appeal
to English tastes, and were little adapted to the less flexible
character of the English tongue. Hence many of the more elaborate
rhyme-systems of Provençal and Northern French lyrical versification
were not imitated at all in English; others were reproduced only in a
modified and often very original form; and only the simpler forms, which
occurred mostly in Low Latin poetry as well, were imitated somewhat
early and with little or no modification.</p>

<p><a name="section216" id="section216"></a>
§ <b>216.</b> The end-rhyme, which is so important a factor in the
formation of stanzas, has many varieties, which may be classified
in three ways:</p>

<p>A.  According to the <b>number</b> of the rhyming syllables.</p>

<p>B.  According to the <b>quality</b> of these syllables.</p>

<p>C.  According to the <b>position of the rhyme</b> in relation to
the line and the stanza.</p>

<p>Intimately connected with this last point is the use of rhyme
as an element in the structure of the stanza.</p>

<p>A. With regard to the number of the syllables, rhymes are divided into
three classes, viz.:</p>

<p>1. The <b>monosyllabic</b> or <b>single rhyme</b> (also called <b>masculine</b>), e.g.
<em>hand: land</em>, <em>face: grace</em>.</p>

<p>2. The <b>disyllabic</b> or <b>double rhyme</b> (also called <b>feminine</b>), as
<em>ever: never</em>, <em>brother: mother</em>, <em>treasure: measure</em>, <em>suppression:
transgression</em>; or <em>owe me: know me</em> Shakesp. Ven. and Ad. 523&ndash;5;
<em>bereft me: left me</em> ib. 439&ndash;41. The terms <em>masculine</em> and <em>feminine</em>
originated with the Provençal poets and metrists, who were the first
among the people of Western Europe to theorize on the structure of the
verses which they employed, and introduced these terms in reference to
the forms of the Provençal adjective, which were monosyllabic or
accented on the last syllable in the masculine, and disyllabic or
accented on the last syllable but one in the feminine: <em>bos&ndash;bona</em>,
<em>amatz&ndash;amada</em>.</p>

<p>3. The <b>trisyllabic, triple</b>, or <b>tumbling rhyme</b>, called<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_273" id="Pg_273" title="273"></a> <em>gleitender</em>
(i.e. gliding) <em>Reim</em> in German. Of this variety of rhyme, which is
less common than the two others, examples are <em>gymnastical:
ecclesiastical</em> Byron, Beppo, 3; <em>quality: liberality</em> ib. 30; <em>láugh of
them: hálf of them</em> ib. 98. Rhymes like this last, which are made up of
more words than two, might, like those given above under the
disyllables, such as <em>owe me: know me</em>, also form a separate sub-species
as <b>compound rhymes</b>, as they resemble the broken rhymes (cf. § 217, B.
3) and have, like these, mostly a burlesque effect.</p>

<p><a name="section217" id="section217"></a>
§ <b>217.</b> B. According to the second principle of classification, by the
quality of the rhyming syllables, the species of rhyme are as follows:</p>

<p>1. The <b>rich rhyme</b> (in French <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rime riche</em>), i.e. two words completely
alike in sound but unlike in meaning rhyming with each other. Of this
three special cases are possible:</p>

<p><em>a.</em> Two simple words rhyming with each other, as <em>londe</em> (inf.):
<em>londe</em> (noun) K. Horn, 753&ndash;4; <em>armes</em> (arms)<em>: armes</em> (weapons)
Chaucer, Compleynt of Mars, ll. 76&ndash;7; <em>steepe</em> (adj.)<em>: steepe</em> (inf.)
Spenser, F. Q. <span class="fakesc">I.</span> i. 39; <em>sent</em> (perf.)<em>: sent</em> (<em>=scent</em>, noun) ib. 43;
<em>can</em> (noun)<em>; can</em> (verb) ib. <span class="fakesc">I.</span> iv. 22, &amp;c. In the earlier Modern
English poetry we find many rhymes of this class between words that are
alike or similar in sound, but of different spelling, as <em>night:
knight</em>, <em>foul: fowl</em>, <em>gilt: guilt</em>, <em>hart: heart</em>, &amp;c. (cf. Ellis,
‘Shakespere’s Puns’ in <cite>Early Engl. Pron.</cite> iii. 920, iv. 1018).</p>

<p><em>b.</em> A simple and a compound word rhyming together, as <em>leue: bileue</em> K.
Horn, 741&ndash;2; <em>like: sellike</em> Sir Tristr. 1222&ndash;4; <em>ymake: make</em>  Wright’s Spec.. of Lyr.
Poetry, p. 27, ll. 16&ndash;18; <em>apart: part</em> Spenser, F. Q. I.
ii. 21, <em>hold: behold</em> ib. <span class="fakesc">I.</span> iii. 40; here also identity of sound and
difference of spelling is possible, as <em>renew: knew</em> ib. <span class="fakesc">I.</span> iii. 25.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> Two compound words rhyming together, as <em>recorde: accorde</em> Chaucer,
C. T. Prol. 828&ndash;9; <em>affirmed: confirmed</em> Wyatt, p. 98; <em>expeld:
compeld</em> Spenser, F. Q. <span class="fakesc">I.</span> i. 5.</p>

<p>2. The <b>identical rhyme</b>. This is, properly speaking, no rhyme at all,
but only a repetition of the same word intended as a substitute for
rhyme; and therefore was and is avoided by careful and skilful poets;
<em>sette: sette</em> K. Horn, 757&ndash;8; <em>other: other</em> Wyatt, p. 45; <em>down:
down</em> ib. p. 194; <em>sight: sight</em> Spenser, F. Q. <span class="fakesc">I.</span> i. 45, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. The <em>broken rhyme</em> has two sub-species:</p>

<p><em>a.</em> In the first of these one part of the rhyme is composed of two or
three words (unlike the rhymes spoken of under A. 3,<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_274" id="Pg_274" title="274"></a> consisting of two
words each), e.g. <em>time: bi me</em> K. Horn, 533&ndash;4; <em>scolis: fole is</em>,
Chaucer, Troil. i. 634&ndash;5; <em>tyrant: high rent</em> Moore, Fudge Fam., Letter
iv; <em>wide as: Midas</em> ib.; <em>well a day: melody</em> ib. x; <em>Verona: known
a</em> Byron, Beppo, 17; <em>sad knee: Ariadne</em> ib. 28; <em>endure a: seccatura</em>
ib. 31; <em>estrangement: change meant</em> ib. 53; <em>quote is: notice</em> ib.
48; <em>exhibit ’em: libitum</em> ib. 70; <em>Julia: truly a: newly a</em> Byron,
Don Juan, ii. 208.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> In the second sub-species the rhyme to a common word is formed by
the first part only of a longer word, the remainder standing at the
beginning of the following line. This sort of rhyme seems to be unknown
in Middle English literature; modern poets, however, use it not
unfrequently in burlesque, as well as the previously mentioned
sub-species, e.g. <em>kind: blind-</em>(<em>ness</em>) Pope, Satire iii. 67;
<em>forget-</em>(<em>ful</em>): <em>debt</em> ib. iv. 13; <em>beg: egge-</em>(<em>shells</em>) ib. iv.
104; <em>nice hence-</em>(<em>forward</em>)<em>: licence</em> Byron, Don Juan, i. 120;
Thackeray, Ballads, p. 133:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="line indent2">er looks into St. James’s Park.</div>
  </div>

<p>4. The <b>double rhyme</b>. This is always trisyllabic like that mentioned
under <span class="gesperrt">A. 3</span>; but there is a difference between them, in that the two
closing syllables of the gliding rhyme stand outside the regular rhythm
of the verse; while the first and the third syllable of the double rhyme
bear the second last and last arsis of the verse.</p>

<p>This sort of rhyme does on the whole not very often occur in Modern
English poetry, and even in Middle English literature we ought to regard
it as accidental. The same is the case with another (more frequent)
species, namely,</p>

<p>5. The <b>extended rhyme</b>, in which an unaccented syllable preceding the
rhyme proper, or an unaccented word in thesis, forms part of the rhyme,
e.g. <em>biforne: iborne</em> Chaucer, Troil. ii. 296&ndash;8; <em>in joye: in Troye</em>
ib. i. 118&ndash;19; <em>to quyken: to stiken</em> ib. 295&ndash;7; <em>the Past: me last</em>
Byron, Ch. Harold, ii. 96; <em>the limb: the brim</em> ib. iii. 8, &amp;c.</p>

<p>6. The <b>unaccented rhyme</b>, an imperfect kind of rhyme, because only the
unaccented syllables of disyllabic or poly<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_275" id="Pg_275" title="275"></a>syllabic words, mostly of
Germanic origin and accentuation, rhyme together, and not their accented
syllables as the ordinary rule would demand, e.g. <em>láweles</em>, <em>lóreless</em>,
<em>námeless</em>; <em>wrécful</em>, <em>wróngful</em>, <em>sínful</em> Song of the Magna Charta, ll.
30&ndash;2, 66&ndash;8; many rhymes of this kind occur in the alliterative-rhyming
long line combined into stanzas.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> In Modern English we find this
kind of rhyme pretty often in Wyatt<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>; e.g.:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Consider well thy ground and thy beginning;</div>
    <div class="line">And gives the moon her horns, and her eclipsing.</div>

    <div class="line">A wrongful death, and justice alway seeketh.</div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="attribution">p. 149.</div>

<p>Such rhymes in dactylic feet, as in the following verses by Moore
(<cite>Beauty and Song</cite> ll. 1&ndash;4),</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Dówn in yon súmmer vale,</div>

    <div class="line">Thús said the Níghtingale</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Tó his loved Róse,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>are not harsh, because in this case the unaccented syllable which bears
the rhyme is separated from the accented syllable by a thesis. A variety
of the unaccented rhyme is called the <b>accented-unaccented</b>; examples
have been quoted before in the chapter treating of the
alliterative-rhyming long line (§§ <a href="#section61">61</a>, <a href="#section62">62</a>). In the same place some other
verses of the above-quoted song of Moore are given, showing the
admissibility of rhymes between gliding or trisyllabic and masculine
rhyming-syllables or -words (<em>mélodý: thée</em>, <em>Róse bè: thée</em>). In these
cases the subordinate accent of the third syllable in <em>mélody</em> or the
word <em>bè</em> in the equally long <em>Róse bè</em> is strong enough to make a rhyme
with <em>thee</em> possible, although this last word has a strong syntactical
and rhythmical accent. As a rule such accented-unaccented rhymes, in
which masculine endings rhyme with feminine endings, are very harsh, as
is often the case in Wyatt’s poems (cf. Alscher, pp. 123&ndash;6), e.g.</p>

<p><a name="section218" id="section218"></a>
§ <b>218.</b> C. According to the third principle of classification, by the
position of the rhyming syllable, the varieties of rhyme are as follows:</p>

<p>1. The <b>sectional rhyme</b>, so called because it consists of two rhyming
words within one section or hemistich.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> This kind of rhyme occurs
now and then even in Old English poetry, but it is usually unintentional
(cf. §§ 40&ndash;2), e.g. <em>sǣla and mǣla</em>; <em>þæt is sōð metod</em> Beow.
1611; in Middle English literature it is frequent, as in Barbour’s
Bruce: <em>and till Ingland agayne is gayne</em> i. 144, iii. 185; <em>That eftyr
him dar na man ga</em> iii. 166. In Modern English poetry this kind of rhyme
is more frequent, and often intentionally used for artistic effect:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Then up with your cup, | till you stagger in speech,</div>
    <div class="line">And match me this catch, | though you swagger and screech,</div>
    <div class="line">Ah, drink till you wink, | my merry men, each.</div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="attribution">Walter Scott, Song from Kenilworth.</div>

<p>2. Very closely related to this is the <b>inverse rhyme</b> (as
Guest called it), which occurs when the last accented syllable of
the first hemistich of a verse rhymes with the first accented
syllable of the second hemistich:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">These steps both reach | and teach thee shall</div>
    <div class="line">To come by thrift | to shift withall.</div>
     <div class="attribution">Tusser.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This kind of rhyme is generally met with in the popular national long
line of four stresses. Guest gives a much wider range to it. But when it
occurs in other kinds of verse, as in the iambic verse of four or five
feet, it is not to be looked upon as an intentional rhyme, but only as a
consonance caused by rhetorical repetition (the examples are quoted by
Guest):</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">And art thou gone and gone for ever? <span class="attrib">Burns.</span></div>
    <div class="line">I followed fast, but faster did he fly. <span class="attrib">Shak. Mids. <span class="fakesc">III.</span> ii. 416.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>3. The <b>Leonine<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> rhyme</b> or <b>middle rhyme</b>, which recurs throughout
the Old English <cite>Rhyming Poem</cite>, and is occasionally used in other Old
English poems. This rhyme connects the two hemistichs of an alliterative
line with each other by end-rhyme and, at the same time, causes the
gradual breaking up of<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_277" id="Pg_277" title="277"></a> it into two short lines; we find it in certain
parts of the <cite>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</cite>, in Layamon, in the <cite>Proverbs of
Alfred</cite>, and other poems, e.g.: <em>his sedes to</em> sowen, <em>his medes to</em>
mowen Prov. 93&ndash;4; <em>þus we uerden</em> þere, <em>and for þi beoþ nu</em> here Lay.
1879&ndash;80. See §§ <a href="#section49">49</a>, <a href="#section57">57&ndash;58</a>, <a href="#section78">78</a> for examples from Middle and Modern
English literature of this kind of rhyme (called by the French <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rimes
plates</em>) as well as of the following kind, when used in even-beat
metres.</p>

<p>4. The <b>interlaced rhyme</b> (<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rime entrelacée</em>), by means of which two
long-lined rhyming couplets are connected a second time in corresponding
places (before the caesura) by another rhyme, so that they seem to be
broken up into four short verses of alternate or cross-rhyme (<em>a b a
b</em>), e.g. in the latter part of Robert Mannyng’s <cite>Rhyming Chronicle</cite>
(from p. 69 of Hearne’s edition), or in the second version of <cite>Saynt
Katerine</cite> (cf. the quotations, §§ <a href="#section77">77</a>, <a href="#section78">78</a>, <a href="#section150">150</a>). When, however, long
verses without interlaced rhyme are broken up only by the arrangement of
the writer or printer into short lines, we have</p>

<p>5. The <b>intermittent rhyme</b>, whose formula is <em>a b c b</em> (cf. p. <a href="#Pg_196">196</a>).
Both sorts of rhyme may also be used, of course, in other kinds of
verse, shorter or longer; as a rule, however, the intermittent rhyme is
employed for shorter, the alternate or cross-rhyme for longer verses,
as, for example, those of five feet.</p>

<p>6. The <b>enclosing rhyme</b>, corresponding to the formula <em>a b b a</em>, e.g.
in <em>spray, still, fill, May</em>, as in the quartets of the sonnet formed
after the Italian model (cf. below, Book II, <a href="#Pg_371">chap. ix</a>). This sort of
rhyme does not often occur in Middle English poetry; but we find it
later, e.g. in the tail or veer of a variety of stanza used by Dunbar
and Kennedy in their <cite>Flyting Poem</cite>.</p>

<p>7. The <b>tail-rhyme</b> (in French called <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rime couée</em>, in German
<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schweifreim</em>), the formula of which is <em>a a b c c b</em>. (For a specimen
see § <a href="#section79">79</a>.)</p>

<p>This arrangement of rhymes originated from two long lines of the same
structure, formed into a couplet by end-rhyme, each of the lines being
divided into three sections (whence the name <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">versus tripertiti
caudati</cite>). This couplet, the formula of which was <em>&ndash; a &ndash; a &ndash;  b || &ndash; c &ndash; c
&ndash; b</em>, is, in the form in which it actually appears broken up into a
stanza of six short lines, viz. two longer couplets <em>a a</em>, <em>c c</em>, and a
pair of shorter lines rhyming together as <em>b b</em>, the order of rhymes
being <em>a a b c c b</em>. (For remarks on the origin of this stanza see <a href="#section240">§
240.</a>)</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_278" id="Pg_278" title="278"></a></p>

<p><a name="section219" id="section219"></a>
§ <b>219.</b> As to the quality of the rhyme, purity or exactness, of course,
is and always has been a chief requirement. It is, however, well known
that the need for this exactness is frequently disregarded not only in
Old and Middle English poetry (cf. e.g. the Old English assonances meant
for rhymes, § <a href="#section40">40</a>, or the often very defective rhymes of Layamon, § <a href="#section45">45</a>)
but even in Modern English poetry. Many instructive examples of
defective rhymes from Spenser, Sidney, Shakespeare, and Dryden are given
by A.J. Ellis, <cite>On Early Engl. Pronunciation</cite>, iii. 858&ndash;74, 953&ndash;66, iv.
1033&ndash;9.</p>

<p>From these collections of instances we see how a class of imperfect
rhymes came into existence in consequence of the change in the
pronunciation of certain vowels, from which it resulted that many pairs
of words that originally rhymed together, more or less perfectly, ceased
to be rhymes at all to the ear, although, as the spelling remained
unaltered, they retained in their written form a delusive appearance of
correspondence. These ‘eye-rhymes’, as they are called, play an
important part in English poetry, being frequently admitted by later
poets, who continue to rhyme together words such as <em>eye: majesty</em> Pope,
Temple of Fame, 202&ndash;3; <em>crowns: owns</em> ib. 242&ndash;3; <em>own’d: found</em> id. Wife
of Bath, 32&ndash;3, notwithstanding the fact that the vowel of the two words,
which at first formed perfect rhymes, had long before been diphthongized
or otherwise changed while the other word still kept its original
vowel-sound.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="subtitle">THE RHYME AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT
  OF THE STANZA</span></h3>

<p><a name="section220" id="section220"></a>
§ <b>220.</b> On the model of the Provençal and Northern French lyrics, where
the rhyme was indispensable in the construction of stanzas, rhyme found
a similar employment in Middle English poetry. Certain simple kinds of
stanzas, however, were in their formation just as much influenced by the
Low Latin hymn forms, in which at that time rhyme had long been in
vogue.</p>

<p>But the rules prescribed for the formation of stanzas by the Provençal
poets in theory and practice were observed neither by the Northern
French, nor by the Middle English poets with equal rigour, although
later on, it is true, in the court-poetry greater strictness prevailed
than in popular lyrical poetry.</p>

<p>One of the chief general laws relating to the use of rhyme in the
formation of stanzas has already been mentioned in § <a href="#section214">214</a> (at the end). A
few other points of special importance require to be noticed here.</p>

<p>Both in Middle English and in Romanic poetry we find stanzas with a
single rhyme only and stanzas with varied rhymes. But the use of the
same rhymes throughout all the stanzas of one poem (in German called
<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Durchreimung</em>), so frequent in Romanic literature, occurs in Middle
English poetry only in some later poems imitated directly from Romanic
models. As a rule, both where the rhyme in the same stanza is single and
where it is varied, all the stanzas have different rhymes, and only the
rhyme-system, the arrangement of rhymes, is the same throughout the
poem. It is, however, very rarely and only in Modern English literary
poetry that the several stanzas are strictly uniform with regard to the
use of masculine and feminine rhyme; as a rule the two kinds are
employed. Sometimes, it is true, in the anisometrical ‘lays’, as they
are called, as well as in the later popular ballads (e.g. in <cite>Chevy
Chace</cite> and <cite>The Battle of Otterbourne</cite>), we find single stanzas
deviating from the rest in rhyme-arrangement as well as in number of
lines, the stanzas consisting of Septenary lines with cross-rhymes and
inter<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_280" id="Pg_280" title="280"></a>mittent rhymes (<em>a b a b</em>, and <em>a b c b</em>) being combined now and
then with tail-rhyme. This is found to a still greater extent in lyrical
poetry of the seventeenth century (e.g. Cowley, G. Herbert, &amp;c.) as well
as in odic stanzas of the same or a somewhat later period.</p>

<p><a name="section221" id="section221"></a>
§ <b>221.</b> It does not often happen in Middle English poetry that a line
is not connected by rhyme with a corresponding line in the same stanza
to which it belongs, but only with one in the next stanza. In Modern
English poetry this peculiarity, corresponding to what are called
<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Körner</em> in German metres, may not unfrequently be observed in certain
poetic forms of Italian origin, as the terza rima or the sestain. Of
equally rare occurrence in English strophic poetry are lines without any
rhyme (analogous to the <em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Waisen</em>&mdash;literally ‘orphans’&mdash;of Middle High
German poetry), which were strictly prohibited in Provençal poetry. In
Middle English literature they hardly ever occur, but are somewhat more
frequent in Modern English poetry, where they generally come at the end
of the stanza. On the other hand the mode of connecting successive
stanzas, technically called <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Concatenatio</em> (rhyme-linking), so
frequently used by the Provençal and Northern French poets, is very
common in Middle English verse. Three different varieties of this device
are to be distinguished, viz.:</p>

<p>1. The repetition of the rhyme-word (or of a word standing close by it)
of the last line of a stanza, at the beginning of the first line of the
following stanza.</p>

<p>2. The repetition of the whole last line of a stanza, including the
rhyme-word, as the initial line of the following stanza (not very
common); and</p>

<p>3. The repetition of the last rhyme of a stanza as the first rhyme of
the following one; so that the last rhyme-word of one stanza and the
first rhyme-word of the next not only rhyme with the corresponding
rhyme-words of their own stanzas, but also with one another. Such
‘concatenations’ frequently connect the first and the last part (i.e.
the <em>frons</em> and the <em>cauda</em>) of a stanza with each other. They even
connect the single lines of the same stanza and sometimes of a whole
poem, with each other, as e.g. in the ‘Rhyme-beginning Fragment’ in
Furnivall’s <cite>Early English Poems and Lives of Saints</cite>, p. 21 (cf.
<cite>Metrik</cite>, i, p. 317)</p>

<p><a name="section222" id="section222"></a>
§ <b>222.</b> Another and more usual means of connecting the single stanzas
of a poem with each other is the <b>refrain</b> (called by the Provençal
poets <em>refrim</em>, i.e. ‘echo’; by German metrists<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_281" id="Pg_281" title="281"></a> sometimes called
<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kehrreim</em>, i.e. recurrent rhyme). The refrain is of popular origin,
arising from the part taken by the people in popular songs or
ecclesiastical hymns by repeating certain exclamations, words, or
sentences at the end of single lines or stanzas. The refrain generally
occurs at the end of a stanza, rarely in the interior of a stanza or in
both places, as in a late ballad quoted by Ritson, <em>Ancient Songs and
Ballads</em>, ii. 75.</p>

<p>In Old English poetry the refrain is used in one poem only, viz. in
<cite>Deor’s Complaint</cite>, as the repetition of a whole line. In Middle and
Modern English poetry the refrain is much more extensively employed. Its
simplest form, consisting of the repetition of certain exclamations or
single words after each stanza, occurs pretty often in Middle English.
Frequent use is also made of the other form, in which one line is
partially or entirely repeated. Sometimes, indeed, two or even more
lines are repeated, or a whole stanza is added as refrain to each of the
main stanzas, and is then placed at the beginning of the poem (cf.
Wright’s <cite>Spec. of Lyr. Poetry</cite>, p. 51).</p>

<p>In English the refrain is also called <em>burthen</em>, and consists (according
to Guest) of the entire or at least partial repetition of the same
words. Distinct from the burthen or refrain is the <em>wheel</em>, which is
only the repetition of the same rhythm as an addition to a stanza. In
Middle English poetry especially a favourite form was that in which a
stanza consisting mostly of alliterative-rhyming verses or half-verses
(cf. §§ <a href="#section60">60</a>, <a href="#section61">61</a>, <a href="#section66">66</a>) is followed by an addition (the <em>cauda</em>), differing
very much from the rhythmical structure of the main part (the <em>frons</em>)
of the stanza, and connected with it by means of a very short verse
consisting of only one arsis and the syllable or syllables forming the
thesis. This short verse is called by Guest <em>bob-verse</em>, and the
<em>cauda</em>, connected with the chief stanza by means of such a verse, he
calls <em>bob-wheel</em>, so that the whole stanza, which is of a very
remarkable form, might be called the <em>bob-wheel stanza</em>. The similar
form of stanza, also very common, where the chief part of the stanza is
connected with the ‘cauda’, not by a ‘bob-verse’ but by an ordinary long
line, might be called the <em>wheel-stanza</em>. These remarks now bring us to
other considerations of importance with regard to the formation of the
stanza, which will be treated of in the next section.</p>

<p><a name="section223" id="section223"></a>
§ <b>223. The structure and arrangement of the different parts of the
stanza</b> in Middle English poetry were also modelled on Low Latin and
especially on Romanic forms.</p>

<p>The theory of the structure of stanzas in Provençal and Italian<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_282" id="Pg_282" title="282"></a> is
given along with much interesting matter in Dante’s treatise <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De vulgari
eloquentia</cite><a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>, where the original Romanic technical terms are found.
Several terms used in this book have also been taken from German
metrics.</p>

<p>In the history of Middle English poetry two groups of stanzas must be
distinguished: <em>divisible</em> and <em>indivisible</em> stanzas (the <em>one-rhymed</em>
stanzas being included in the latter class). The divisible stanzas
consist either of two equal parts (<em>bipartite equal-membered stanzas</em>)
or of two unequal parts (<em>bipartite unequal-membered stanzas</em>) or
thirdly of two equal parts and an unequal one (<em>tripartite stanzas</em>).
Now and then (especially in Modern English poetry) they consist of three
equal parts. These three types are common to Middle and Modern English
poetry. A fourth class is met with in Modern English poetry only, viz.
stanzas generally consisting of <em>three</em>, sometimes of <em>four</em> or more
<em>unequal parts</em>.</p>

<p>All the kinds of verse that have been previously described in this work
can be used in these different classes of stanzas, both separately and
conjointly. In each group, accordingly, <em>isometrical</em> and
<em>anisometrical</em> stanzas must be distinguished. Very rarely, and only in
Modern English, we find that even the rhythm of the separate verses of a
stanza is not uniform; iambic and trochaic, anapaestic and dactylic, or
iambic and anapaestic verses interchanging with each other, so that a
further distinction between <em>isorhythmical</em> and <em>anisorhythmical</em>
stanzas is possible.</p>

<p><a name="section224" id="section224"></a>
§ <b>224.</b> The <b>bipartite equal-membered</b> stanzas, in their simplest form,
consist of two equal periods, each composed of a prior and a succeeding
member. They are to be regarded as the primary forms of all strophic
poetry.</p>

<p>The two periods may be composed either of two rhyming couplets or of
four verses rhyming alternately with each other. Specimens of both
classes have been quoted above (§ 78). Such equal-membered stanzas can
be extended, of course, in each part uniformly without changing the
isometrical character of the stanza.</p>

<p><a name="section225" id="section225"></a>
§ <b>225.</b> The <b>bipartite unequal-membered</b> stanzas belong to a more
advanced stage in the formation of the stanza. They are, however, found
already in Provençal poetry, and consist of the ‘forehead’ (<em>frons</em>) and
the ‘tail’ or veer (<em>cauda</em>). The <em>frons</em> and the <em>cauda</em> differ
sometimes only in the number of<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_283" id="Pg_283" title="283"></a> verses, and consequently, in the order
of the rhymes, and sometimes also in the nature of the verse. The two
parts may either have quite different rhymes or be connected together by
one or several common rhymes. As a simple specimen of this sort of
stanza the first stanza of Dunbar’s <em>None may assure in this warld</em> may
be quoted here:</p>

<div class="pad10">
  <div class="xyz">frons&nbsp;:
   </div><div class="xyz"><span class="stache40">{</span>
   </div><div class="xyz"><em>Quhome to sall I complene my wo,<br />
                              And kyth my kairis on or mo?</em>
   </div>
</div>

<div class="pad10">
  <div class="xyz">cauda:
  </div><div class="xyz"><span class="stache40">{</span>
  </div><div class="xyz"><em>&nbsp; I knaw nocht, amang riche nor pure,<br />
                           Quha is my freynd, quha is my fo;<br />
                          &nbsp; For in this warld may non assure.</em>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In literary poetry, however, the tripartite stanzas are commoner than
the bipartite unequal-membered stanzas just noticed; they are as much in
favour as the bipartite, equal-membered stanzas are in popular poetry.
In Provençal and Northern French poetry the principle of a triple
partition in the structure of stanzas was developed very early. Stanzas
on these models were very soon imported into Middle English poetry.</p>

<p><a name="section226" id="section226"></a>
§ <b>226.</b> The <b>tripartite</b> stanzas generally (apart from Modern English
forms) consist of two equal parts and one unequal part, which admit of
being arranged in different ways. They have accordingly different names.
If the two equal parts precede they are called <em>pedes</em>, both together
the <em>opening</em> (in German <em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Aufgesang</em> =‘upsong’); the unequal part that
concludes the stanza is called the <em>conclusion</em> or the <em>veer</em>, <em>tail</em>,
or <em>cauda</em> (in German <em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Abgesang</em> =‘downsong’). If the unequal part
precedes it is called <em>frons</em> (=‘forehead’); the two equal parts that
form the end of the stanza are called <em>versus</em> (‘turns,’ in German
<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wenden</em>). The former arrangement, however, is by far the more frequent.</p>

<p>There are various ways of separating the first from the last part of the
stanza: (a) by a pause, which, as a rule, in Romanic as well as in
Middle English poetry occurs between the two chief parts; (b) by a
difference in their structure (whether in rhyme-arrangement only, or
both in regard to the kinds and the number of verses). But even then the
two chief parts are generally separated by a pause. We thus obtain three
kinds of tripartite stanzas:</p>

<p>1. Stanzas in which the first and the last part differ in
<em>versification</em>; the lines of the last part may either be longer or
shorter than those of the ‘pedes’. Difference in rhythmical structure as
well as in length of line is in Middle English<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_284" id="Pg_284" title="284"></a> poetry confined to the
<em>bob-wheel</em> stanzas, and is not otherwise common except in Modern
English poetry.</p>

<p>2. Stanzas in which the parts differ in <em>number of verses</em>. The number
may be either greater or smaller in the last part than in the two
‘pedes’, which, of course, involves at the same time a difference in the
order of the rhymes. Change of length, however, and change of
versification in the last part in comparison with the half of the first
part are generally combined.</p>

<p>3. Stanzas in which the parts agree in versification but <em>differ in the
arrangement of the rhymes</em>; the number of verses in the <em>cauda</em> being
either the same as that of one of the <em>pedes</em>, or (as commonly the case)
different from it.</p>

<p>In all these cases the first and the last part of the stanza may have
quite different rhymes, or they may, in stanzas of more artistic
construction, have one or several rhymes in common.</p>

<p>If the <em>frons</em> precedes the <em>versus</em>, the same distinctions, of course,
are possible between the two chief parts.</p>

<p>Theoretically, the second stanza might also be regarded as a stanza
consisting of two <em>pedes</em> and two <em>versus</em>, or, in other words, as a
four-part stanza of two equal parts in each half. Stanzas of this kind
occur pretty often in Middle and Modern English poetry. They mostly,
however, convey the effect of a tripartite stanza on account of the
greater extent of the one pair of equal parts of the stanza.</p>

<p>The tripartition effected only by a difference in the arrangement of
rhymes either in the <em>pedes</em> and the <em>cauda</em>, or in the <em>frons</em> and the
<em>versus</em>, will be illustrated by the following specimens:</p>

<p>A very rare variety of tripartition that, as far as we know, does not
occur till Modern English times, is that by which the <em>cauda</em> is placed
between the two <em>pedes</em>. This arrangement, of course, may occur in each
of the three kinds of tripartition. A specimen of the last kind (viz.
that in which the <em>cauda</em> is distinguished from the <em>pedes</em> by a
different arrangement of rhymes) may suffice to explain it:</p>

<p>Lastly, it is to be remarked that the inequality of Modern English
stanzas, which may be composed of two or three or several parts, admits,
of course, of many varieties. Generally, however, their structure is
somewhat analogous to that of the regular tripartite stanzas (cf. below,
Book II, chap. vi).</p>

<p>In Romanic poetry the tripartite structure sometimes was carried on also
through the whole song, it being composed either of three or six stanzas
(that is to say, of three equal groups of stanzas), or, what is more
usual, of seven or five stanzas (i.e. of two equal parts and an unequal
part). In Middle English literary poetry, too, this practice is fairly
common;<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> in Modern English poetry, on the other hand, it occurs only
in the most recent times, being chiefly adopted in imitations of Romanic
forms of stanza, especially the <em>ballade</em>.</p>

<p><a name="section228" id="section228"></a>
§ <b>228. The envoi.</b> Closely connected with the last-mentioned point,
viz. the partition of the whole poem, is the structural element in
German called <em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geleit</em>, in Provençal poetry <em>tornada</em> (i.e. ‘turning’,
‘apostrophe’, or ‘address’), in Northern French poetry <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">envoi</em>, a term
which was retained sometimes by Middle English poets as the title for
this kind of stanza (occasionally even for a whole poem). The tornada
used chiefly in the ballade is a sort of epilogue to the poem proper. It
was a rule in Provençal poetry (observed often in Old French also) that
it must agree in form with the concluding part of the preceding stanza.
It was also necessary that with regard to its tenor it should have some
sort of connexion with the poem; although, as a rule, its purpose was to
give expression to personal feelings. The tornada is either a sort of
farewell which the poet addresses to the poem itself, or it contains the
order to a messenger to deliver the poem to the poet’s mistress or to
one of his patrons; sometimes these persons are directly praised or
complimented. In Middle English poetry the envoi mostly serves the same
purposes. But there are some variations from the Provençal custom both
as to contents and especially as to form.</p>

<p><a name="section229" id="section229"></a>
§ <b>229.</b> We may distinguish <em>three kinds</em> of so-called envois in Middle
English poetry: (1) Real envois. (2) Concluding stanzas resembling
envois as to their form. (3) Concluding stanzas resembling envois as to
their contents.</p>

<p>The most important are the <em>real envois</em>. Of these, two subordinate
species can be distinguished: (<em>a</em>) when the form of<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_287" id="Pg_287" title="287"></a> the envoi differs
from the form of the stanza, as in Wright’s <cite>Spec. of Lyr. Poetry</cite>, p.
92, and even more markedly in Chaucer’s <cite>Compleynt to his Purse</cite>, a poem
of stanzas of seven lines, the envoi of which addressed to the king
consists of five verses only; (<em>b</em>) when the form of the envoi is the
same as that of the other stanzas of the poem, as e.g. in Wright’s
<cite>Spec. of Lyr. Poetry</cite>, p. 111 (a greeting to a mistress), in Dunbar’s
<cite>Goldin Targe</cite> (address to the poem itself).</p>

<p>When the poem is of some length the envoi may consist of several
stanzas; thus in Chaucer’s <cite>Clerkes Tale</cite> (stanzas of seven lines) the
envoi has six stanzas of six lines each.</p>

<p><em>Concluding stanzas resembling envois in their form</em> are generally
shorter than the chief stanzas, but of similar structure. Generally
speaking they are not very common. Specimens may be found in Wright’s
<cite>Spec. of Lyr. Poetry</cite>, pp. 38, 47, &amp;c.</p>

<p><em>Concluding stanzas resembling envois in their contents.</em> An example
occurs in Wright’s <cite>Spec. of Lyr. Poetry</cite>, p. 31, where the concluding
stanza contains an address to another poet. Religious poems end with
addresses to God, Christ, the Virgin, invitations to prayer, &amp;c.; for
examples see Wright’s <cite>Spec. of Lyr. Poetry</cite>, p. 111, and <cite>Hymns to the
Virgin</cite> (ed. Furnivall, E. E. T. S. 24), p. 39, &amp;c. All these may
possibly fall under this category.</p>

<p>Even in Modern English poetry the envoi has not quite gone out of use.
Short envois occur in Spenser, <cite>Epithalamium</cite>; S. Daniel, <cite>To the Angel
Spirit of Sir Philip Sidney</cite> (Poets, iv. 228); W. Scott, <cite>Marmion</cite>
(Envoy, consisting of four-foot verses rhyming in couplets), <cite>Harold</cite>,
<cite>Lord of the Isles</cite>, <cite>Lady of the Lake</cite> (Spenserian stanzas); Southey,
<cite>Lay of the Laureate</cite> (x. 139&ndash;74), &amp;c.; Swinburne, <cite>Poems and Ballads</cite>,
i, pp. 1, 5, 141, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Concluding stanzas resembling envois occur pretty often in poets of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, as Carew, Donne, Cowley, Waller,
Dodsley, &amp;c. (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, p. 794 note).</p>

  STANZAS COMMON TO MIDDLE AND MODERN<br />
  ENGLISH, AND OTHERS FORMED ON THE<br />
  ANALOGY OF THESE</span></h2>




<h3>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="subtitle">
  BIPARTITE EQUAL-MEMBERED STANZAS</span></h3>


<h4>I. <em>Isometrical stanzas.</em></h4>

<p><a name="section230" id="section230"></a>
§ <b>230. Two-line stanzas.</b> The simplest bipartite equal-membered stanza
is that of two isometrical verses only. In the Northern English
translation of the Psalms (<cite>Surtees Society</cite>, vols. xvi and xix) we
find, for the most part, two-line stanzas of four-foot verses rhyming in
couplets, occasionally alternating with stanzas of four, six, eight, or
more lines.</p>

<p>In Middle English poetry, however, this form was generally used for
longer poems that were not arranged in stanzas. Although it would be
possible to divide some of these (e.g. the <cite>Moral Ode</cite>), either
throughout or in certain parts, into bipartite stanzas, there is no
reason to suppose that any strophic arrangement was intended.</p>

<p>In Modern English, on the other hand, such an arrangement is often
intentional, as in R. Browning, <cite>The Boy and the Angel</cite> (iv. 158), a
poem of four-foot trochaic verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="line">Morning, evening, noon and night</div>
      <div class="line">‘Praise God!’ sang Theocrite.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="line">Then to his poor trade he turned,</div>
      <div class="line">Whereby the daily meal was earned.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Similar stanzas in other metres occur in Longfellow, Tennyson,
Thackeray, Rossetti, &amp;c.; among them we find e.g. eight-foot trochaic
and iambic-anapaestic verses (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 3).</p>

<p><a name="section231" id="section231"></a>
§ <b>231.</b> More frequently we find <b>four-line stanzas</b>, consisting of
couplets. In Middle English lyric poetry such stanzas of two short
couplets are occasionally met with as early as in the <cite>Surtees Psalms</cite>,
but they occur more frequently in Modern English, e.g. in M. Arnold,
<cite>Urania</cite> (p. 217), and in Carew, e.g. <cite>The Inquiry</cite> (Poets, iii):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="line">Amongst the myrtles as I walk’d,</div>
      <div class="line">Love and my sighs thus intertalk’d:</div>
      <div class="line">‘Tell me,’ said I, in deep distress,</div>
      <div class="line">‘Where I may find my shepherdess.’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Regular alternation of masculine and feminine rhymes is very rarely
found in this simple stanza (or indeed in any Middle English stanzas);
it is, properly speaking, only a series of rhyming couplets with a stop
after every fourth line.</p>

<p>This stanza is very popular, as are also various analogous four-line
stanzas in other metres. One of these is the quatrain of four-foot
trochaic verses, as used by M. Arnold in <cite>The Last Word</cite>, and by Milton,
e.g. in <cite>Psalm CXXXVI</cite>, where the two last lines form the refrain, so
that the strophic arrangement is more distinctly marked. Stanzas of
four-foot iambic-anapaestic lines we find e.g. in Moore, <cite>’Tis the last
Rose of Summer</cite>, and similar stanzas of five-foot iambic verses in
Cowper, pp. 359, 410; M. Arnold, <cite>Self-Dependence</cite> (last stanza).</p>

<p>Less common are the quatrains of four-foot dactylic lines, of three-foot
iambic-anapaestic lines, of six-foot iambic and trochaic lines, of
seven-foot iambic lines, and of eight-foot trochaic lines. But specimens
of each of these varieties are occasionally met with (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii,
§ 261)</p>

<p><a name="section232" id="section232"></a>
§ <b>232.</b> The double stanza, i.e. that of eight lines of the same
structure (<em>a a b b c c d d</em>), occurs in different kinds of verse. With
lines of four measures it is found, e.g. in Suckling’s poem, <cite>The
Expostulation</cite> (Poets, iii. 749):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="line">Tell me, ye juster deities,</div>
      <div class="line">That pity lover’s miseries,</div>
      <div class="line">Why should my own unworthiness</div>
      <div class="line">Light me to seek my happiness?</div>
      <div class="line">It is as natural, as just,</div>
      <div class="line">Him for to love whom needs I must:</div>
      <div class="line">All men confess that love’s a fire,</div>
      <div class="line">Then who denies it to aspire?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This stanza comes to a better conclusion when it winds up with a
refrain, as in Percy’s <cite>Reliques</cite>, <span class="fakesc">II.</span> ii. 13. One very popular form of
it consists of four-foot trochaic lines, e.g. in<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_290" id="Pg_290" title="290"></a> Burns, p. 197, M.
Arnold, <cite>A Memory Picture</cite>, p. 23 (the two last lines of each stanza
forming a refrain), or of four-foot iambic-anapaestic lines (Burns, <cite>My
heart’s in the Highlands</cite>). Somewhat rarely it is made up of five-foot
iambic or septenaric lines (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 262).<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="section233" id="section233"></a>
§ <b>233.</b> We have next to consider the stanzas of four isometrical lines
with intermittent rhyme (<em>a b c b</em>). As a rule they consist of three- or
four-foot verses, which are really Alexandrines or acatalectic
tetrameters rhyming in long couplets, and only in their written or
printed arrangement broken up into short lines; as, e.g., in the
following half-stanza from the older version of the <cite>Legend of St.
Katherine</cite>, really written in eight-lined stanzas (ed. Horstmann,
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Altenglische Legenden, Neue Folge</cite>, Heilbronn, 1881, p. 242):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="line">He that made heven and erthe</div>
      <div class="line indent2">and sonne and mone for to schine,</div>
      <div class="line">Bring ous into his riche</div>
      <div class="line indent2">and scheld ous fram helle pine!</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Examples of such stanzas of four-foot trochaic and three-foot iambic
verses that occur chiefly in Percy’s <cite>Reliques</cite> (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §
264), but also in M. Arnold, <cite>Calais Sands</cite> (p. 219), <cite>The Church of
Brou, I., The Castle</cite> (p. 13, feminine and masculine verse-endings
alternating), <cite>New Rome</cite>, p. 229, <cite>Parting</cite>, p. 191 (iambic-anapaestic
three-beat and two-beat verses), <cite>Iseult of Ireland</cite>, p. 150 (iambic
verses of five measures); cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 264</p>

<p><a name="section234" id="section234"></a>
§ <b>234.</b> Stanzas of eight lines result from this stanza by doubling, i.
e. by adding a second couplet of the same structure and rhyme to the
original long-line couplet. Such a form with the scheme <em>a b c b d b e
b</em> meet in the complete stanza of the older <cite>Legend of St. Katherine</cite>
just referred to:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="line">He that made heven and erthe</div>
      <div class="line indent2">and sonne and mone for to schine,</div>
      <div class="line">Bring ous into his riche</div>
      <div class="line indent2">and scheld ous fram helle pine!</div>
      <div class="line">Herken, and y you wile telle</div>
      <div class="line indent2">the liif of an holy virgine,</div>
      <div class="line">That treuli trowed in Jhesu Crist:</div>
      <div class="line indent2">hir name was hoten Katerine,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_291" id="Pg_291" title="291"></a></p>

<p>This sort of doubling, however, occurs in Modern English poetry more
rarely than that which is produced by adding a second long-lined
couplet, but with a new rhyme, so that when the stanza is arranged in
short lines we have the scheme <em>a b c b d e f e</em>.</p>

<p>A stanza like this of trochaic lines we find in <cite>Hymns Ancient and
Modern</cite>, No. 419:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="line">King of Saints, to whom the number</div>
      <div class="line indent2">Of Thy starry host is known,</div>
      <div class="line">Many a name, by man forgotten,</div>
      <div class="line indent2">Lives for ever round Thy Throne;</div>
      <div class="line">Lights, which earth-born mists have darkened,</div>
      <div class="line indent2">There are shining full and clear,</div>
      <div class="line">Princes in the court of heaven,</div>
      <div class="line indent2">Nameless, unremembered here.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Still more frequent are stanzas of this kind consisting of four-foot and
three-foot iambic lines, or of two-foot iambic-anapaestic and
trochaic-dactylic lines (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 265)</p>

<p><a name="section235" id="section235"></a>
§ <b>235.</b> More popular than the stanza just noticed is that developed
from the long-lined couplets by inserted rhyme. A very instructive
example of this development is given in the later version of the <cite>Legend
of St. Katherine</cite> (ed. by Horstmann) which is a paraphrase of the older.</p>

<p>The first half-stanza is as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="line">He that made bothe sunne and mone</div>
      <div class="line indent2">In heuene and erthe for to schyne,</div>
      <div class="line">Bringe vs to heuene, with him to wone,</div>
      <div class="line indent2">And schylde vs from helle pyne!</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Stanzas like this, which are frequent in Low Latin, Provençal, and Old
French poetry, are very common in Middle and Modern English poetry.
Examples may be found in Ritson’s <cite>Ancient Songs</cite>, i, p. 40, Surrey, pp.
37, 56, &amp;c., Burns, p.97, &amp;c., M. Arnold, <cite>Saint Brandan</cite>, p. 165, &amp;c.
Masculine and feminine rhymes do not alternate very often (cf. Percy’s
<cite>Reliques</cite>, <span class="fakesc">I.</span> iii. 13). More frequently we find stanzas with refrain
verses, e.g. Wyatt, p. 70.</p>

<p>Stanzas of this kind consisting of four- or three-foot iambic, trochaic,
iambic-anapaestic, trochaic-dactylic lines, of three-foot iambic lines,
or of two-foot dactylic or other lines are also very common, e.g. in M.
Arnold’s <cite>A Modern Sappho</cite> (with<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_292" id="Pg_292" title="292"></a> alternating masculine and feminine
verse-endings), <cite>Pis Aller</cite> (p. 230), <cite>Requiescat</cite> (p. 21).</p>

<p>Another stanza of great importance is what is called the elegiac stanza,
which consists of four five-foot verses with crossed rhymes. In Middle
English literature it was only used as a part of the <cite>Rhyme-Royal</cite> and
of the eight-lined stanza. In Modern English, however, it has been used
from the beginning more frequently; it occurs already in Wyatt (p. 58):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="line">Heaven and earth and all that hear me plain</div>
      <div class="line indent2">Do well perceive what care doth make me cry</div>
      <div class="line">Save you alone, to whom I cry in vain;</div>
      <div class="line indent2">Mercy, Madam, alas! I die, I die!</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Other examples are found in M. Arnold’s poems <cite>Palladium</cite> (p. 251),
<cite>Revolutions</cite> (p. 254), <cite>Self Deception</cite> (p. 225, with alternate
masculine and feminine rhymes). This stanza is very popular throughout
the Modern English period (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 267).</p>

<p>Stanzas of this kind, however, consisting of trochaic verses, of
six-foot (as in Tennyson’s <cite>Maud</cite>), seven- and eight-foot metres are not
very frequently met with (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 269)</p>

<p><a name="section236" id="section236"></a>
§ <b>236.</b> The four-lined, cross-rhyming stanza gives rise by doubling to
the eight-lined (<em>a b a b a b a b</em>), which occurs very often in Middle
English, as in Wright’s <cite>Spec. of Lyr. Poetry</cite>, p. 99, or in the
<cite>Luve-Rone</cite> by Thomas de Hales, ed. Morris (<cite>Old Eng. Misc.</cite>, p. 93),
where both masculine and feminine rhymes are used:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">A Mayde cristes me bit yorne,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">þat ich hire wurche a luue ron:</div>

    <div class="line">Ich hire nule nowiht werne,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">ich hire wule teche as ic con.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Stanzas of this kind are met with also in Modern English, as in Burns
(p. 262); stanzas of four-stressed lines are found in Wright’s <cite>Spec. of
Lyr. Poetry</cite>, p. 110, and others of three-foot verses in <cite>Polit. Poems</cite>,
i. 270.</p>

<p>There is still another mode of doubling, by which the four originally
long-lined verses are broken up by the use of two<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_293" id="Pg_293" title="293"></a> different inserted
rhymes; the scheme is then: <em>a b a b c b c b</em>. This is the stanza to
which the second version of the <cite>Legend of St. Katherine</cite> has been
adapted in paraphrasing it from the first (cf. §§ <a href="#section77">77</a>, <a href="#section78">78</a>, <a href="#section235">235</a>):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

    <div class="line indent2">Here name was callyd Kateryne.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This stanza occurs, e.g., in Burns (p. 201). Less common is the form of
stanza <em>a b a b a c a c</em> (e.g. in Wyatt, p. 48) resulting from the
breaking up two rhyming couplets of long lines by inserted rhyme (not
from four long lines with one rhyme).</p>

<p>The common mode of doubling is by adding to a four-lined stanza a second
of exactly the same structure, but with new rhymes. Some few examples
occur in Middle English in the <cite>Surtees Psalter,</cite> Ps. xliv, ll. 11, 12.
Very frequently, however, we find it in Modern English constructed of
the most varying metres, as, e.g., of five-foot iambic verses in
Milton, <cite>Psalm VIII</cite> (vol. iii, p. 29):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">O Jehovah our Lord, how wondrous great</div>
    <div class="line indent2">And glorious is thy name through all the earth,</div>

    <div class="line">d slack the avenger’s brow,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">That bends his rage thy providence to oppose.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>More popular are stanzas of this kind consisting of three- or four-foot
iambic, trochaic, and iambic-anapaestic verses, sometimes with alternate
masculine and feminine rhymes. (For specimens see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 271.)</p>

<p><a name="section237" id="section237"></a>
§ <b>237.</b> Only very few examples occur of the sixteen-lined doubling of
this stanza, according to the scheme <em>a b a b c d c d e f e f g h g
h<sub>2</sub></em>; it occurs, e.g., in Moore, <cite>When Night brings the Hour</cite>. Another
form of eight lines (<em>a b c d . a b c d<sub>3</sub></em>) is met with in Rossetti,
<cite>The Shadows </cite>(ii. 249);<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_294" id="Pg_294" title="294"></a> it seems to be constructed on the analogy of a
six-lined stanza (<em>a b c . a b c</em>), which is used pretty often. This
stanza, which is closely allied to the tail-rhyme stanza described in §
<a href="#section238">238</a>, consists most commonly of four-foot iambic verses; it occurs, e.g.,
in Campbell, <cite>Ode to the Memory of Burns</cite> (p. 19):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Soul of the Poet! whereso’er</div>

    <div class="line">And with thine influence illume</div>
    <div class="line indent2">The gladness of our jubilee.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Specimens of forms of stanzas like this, consisting of other kinds of
verse, e.g. of three-foot trochaic-dactylic verse, as in M. Arnold’s
<cite>The Lord’s Messenger</cite> (p. 231), are given in <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 272</p>

<p><a name="section238" id="section238"></a>
§ <b>238.</b> From the four- and eight-lined bipartite equal-membered
isometrical stanzas, dealt with in the preceding paragraphs, it will be
convenient to proceed to the six-lined stanzas of similar structure. To
these belongs a certain form of the tail-rhyme stanza, the nature and
origin of which will be discussed when we treat of the chief form, which
consists of unequal verses. The isometrical six-lined stanzas to be
discussed here show the same structure as the common tail-rhyme stanza,
viz. <em>a a b c c b</em>. An example is afforded in a song, Ritson, i. 10:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Sith Gabriel gan grete</div>
    <div class="line">Ure ledi Mari swete,</div>

    <div class="line">Thre hundred ful iwisse,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Ant over yeris eighte.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In Modern English this stanza occurs very often, e.g. in Drayton, <cite>To
the New Year</cite> (Poets, iii. 579); as a rule, however, it consists of
four-foot iambic verses; e.g. in Suckling in a song (<cite>Poets</cite>, iii.
748):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">When, dearest, I but think of thee,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_295" id="Pg_295" title="295"></a></p>

<p>In this poem all the tail-verses are feminine throughout; in other cases
there are masculine and feminine verses, more often we find masculine or
feminine exclusively; but usually they interchange without any rule.
Examples of these varieties, and also of similar stanzas consisting of
three-foot trochaic verses, of two- and three-foot iambic-anapaestic,
and of five-foot iambic lines are given in <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 273.</p>

<p>Stanzas of this form consisting of two-stressed verses occurring in
Middle English poems have been quoted in § 65</p>

<p><a name="section239" id="section239"></a>
§ <b>239.</b> A variety that belongs to Modern English only is that in which
the tail-verses are placed at the head of the half-stanzas, according to
the formula <em>a b b a c c</em>. It occurs in Ben Jonson’s <cite>Hymn to God</cite>
(Poets, iv. 561), consisting of two-foot iambic verses; another example,
with four-foot trochaic verses, occurs in Mrs. Browning, <cite>A Portrait</cite>
(iii. 57); cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 274.</p>

<p>A twelve-lined stanza, resulting from the doubling of the six-line
stanza, is found only in Middle English poetry, its arrangement of
rhymes being <em>a a b c c b d d b e e b</em>; or with a more elaborate
rhyme-order, <em>a a b a a b c c b c c b</em>, as in Wright’s <cite>Spec. of Lyr.
Poetry</cite>, p. 41.</p>

<p>Still another modification of the simple six-lined stanza consists in
the addition of a third rhyme-verse to the two rhyming couplets of each
half-stanza; so that an eight-lined stanza results with the scheme <em>a a
a b c c c b</em>. Two specimens of this kind of stanza, consisting of
two-stressed lines and occurring in Early English dramatic poetry, have
been quoted above, § <a href="#section70">70</a>.</p>

<p>The same stanza of two-foot verses occurs in the <cite>Coventry Mysteries</cite>,
p. 342. In Modern English, too, we find it sometimes, consisting of
three-foot iambic verses, as in Longfellow, <cite>King Olaf’s Death Drink</cite>
(p. 577). Stanzas of five-, four-, and two-foot iambic verses and other
metres are likewise in use. (For examples see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 275.)

Some rarely occurring extended forms of this stanza are exemplified in
Metrik, ii, § 277, their schemes being <em>a ~ a ~ b ~ c d ~ d ~ b ~ c<sub>4</sub></em>,
<em>a ~ b ~ c ~ d e ~ f ~ g ~ d<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a b b c a d d c<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a a a a b c c c c
b<sub>4</sub></em>.</p>

<p>Sixteen-lined stanzas of this kind of two-stressed verses (rhyming <em>a a
a b c c c b d d d b e e e b</em>) that were frequently used in Middle
English Romances have been quoted and discussed above, § <a href="#section65">65</a>.</p>

<h4>II. <em>Anisometrical Stanzas.</em></h4>

<p><a name="section240" id="section240"></a>
§ <b>240.</b> In connexion with the last section, the chief species of the
<b>tail-rhyme stanza</b> may be discussed here first of all. This stanza, as
a rule, consists of four four-foot and two three-foot verses, rhyming
according to the scheme <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>; cf. the following
specimen (Wright’s <cite>Spec. of Lyr. Poetry</cite>, p. 101):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Lustneþ alle a lutel þrowe,</div>
    <div class="line">Ȝe þat wolleþ ou selue yknowe,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Unwys þah y be:</div>
    <div class="line">Ichulle telle ou ase y con,</div>
    <div class="line">Hou holy wryt spekeþ of mon;</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Herkneþ nou to me.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The last line of each half-stanza, the tail-verse proper, was originally
simply a refrain. The tripartite character of the half-stanza and the
popular origin of the stanza was shown long ago by Wolf, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Über die Lais,
Sequenzen und Leiche</cite>, p. 27 (cf. <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Engl. Metrik</cite>, i, pp. 353&ndash;7).
According to him this stanza was developed first of all from choruses
sung in turn by the people and from the ecclesiastical responses which
also had a popular origin, and lastly from the sequences and ‘proses’ of
the middle ages.</p>

<p>A sequence-verse such as:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="iline">Egidio psallat coetus | iste laetus | Alleluia,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>in its tripartition corresponds to the first half of the above-quoted
Middle English tail-rhyme stanza:</p>

<div class="iline">Lustneþ alle a lutel þrowe | ȝe þat wolleþ ou selue yknowe |
        Unwys þah y be.</div>

<p>When two long lines like this, connected with each other by the rhyme of
the last section, the two first sections of each line being also
combined by leonine rhyme, are broken up into six short verses, we have
the tail-rhyme stanza in the form above described. This form was
frequently used in Low Latin poetry, and thence passed into Romanic and
Teutonic literature.</p>

<p>A form even more extensively used in Middle and Modern English poetry is
that in which the tail-verse has feminine instead of masculine endings.
A Modern English specimen from Drayton’s poem <cite>To Sir Henry Goodere</cite>
(<cite>Poets</cite>, iii. 576) may be quoted; it begins:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_297" id="Pg_297" title="297"></a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">These lyric pieces, short and few,</div>
    <div class="line">Most worthy Sir, I send to you,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">To read them be not weary:</div>
    <div class="line">They may become John Hewes his lyre,</div>
    <div class="line">Which oft at Powlsworth by the fire</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Hath made us gravely merry.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This, the chief form of the tail-rhyme stanza, has been in use
throughout the whole Modern English period. There has, however, never
been any fixed rule as to the employment of feminine or masculine
rhymes. Sometimes feminine tail-rhymes with masculine couplets are used
(as in the example above), sometimes masculine rhymes only, while in
other instances masculine and feminine rhymes are employed
indiscriminately.</p>

<p>Iambic-anapaestic verses of four or three measures were also sometimes
used in this form of stanza, as in Moore, <cite>Hero and Leander</cite>.</p>

<p>There are a great many varieties of this main form; the stanza may
consist, for instance, of four- and two-foot iambic or trochaic lines,
or of iambic lines of three and two, five and three, five and two
measures, according to the schemes <em>a a b c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>a a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c c<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em>,
<em>a a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c c<sub>5</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em>, and <em>a<sub>3</sub> b b<sub>5</sub> a<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>5</sub></em> (the
tail-verses in front). For examples see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 279</p>

<p><a name="section241" id="section241"></a>
§ <b>241.</b> The next step in the development of this stanza was its
enlargement to twelve lines (<em>a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> d d<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> e e<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>) by
doubling. This form occurs in Wright’s <cite>Spec. of Lyr. Poetry</cite>,
p. 43:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Lenten is come wiþ loue to toune,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>We are not in a position to quote a Modern English specimen of this
stanza, but it was very popular in Middle English poetry,<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_298" id="Pg_298" title="298"></a> both in
lyrics and in legends or romances, and in later dramatic poetry.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="section242" id="section242"></a>
§ <b>242.</b> As to the <b>further development of the tail-rhyme stanza,</b> the
enlarged forms must first be mentioned. They are produced by adding a
third line to the principal lines of each half-stanza; the result being
an eight-lined stanza of the formula <em>a a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>. Stanzas
of this form occur in Early Middle English lyrics, e.g. in Wright’s
<cite>Spec. of Lyr. Poetry</cite>, p. 51 (with a refrain-stanza) and <cite>Polit.
Songs</cite>, p. 187 (four-stressed main verses and two-stressed tail-verses,
the latter having occasionally the appearance of being in three-beat
rhythm).</p>

<p>A later example is found in Dunbar’s poem <cite>Off the Fenȝeit Freir of
Tungland</cite>; in the Miracle Plays the form was also in favour. Isometrical
stanzas of this kind have been mentioned above (§§ <a href="#section238">238</a>, <a href="#section239">239</a>).</p>

<p>In Modern English poetry this stanza is extensively used. We find it in
Drayton, <cite>Nymphidia</cite> (Poets, iii. 177), with feminine tail-verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Old Chaucer doth of Topas tell,</div>
    <div class="line">Mad Rablais of Pantagruel,</div>
    <div class="line">A later third of Dowsabel,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">With such poor trifles playing:</div>
    <div class="line">Others the like have laboured at,</div>
    <div class="line">Some of this thing and some of that,</div>
    <div class="line">And many of they know not what,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">But that they must be saying.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Other examples of this stanza, as of similar ones, consisting of four-
and three-foot trochaic and iambic-anapaestic verses, are given in
<cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 280.</p>

<p>There are some subdivisions of this stanza consisting of verses of three
and two measures, of four and two measures, four and one measure, five
and two, and five and one measure, according to the formulae <em>a a a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub>
c c c<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>a a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>a a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>1</sub> c c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>a a a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c
c c<sub>5</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>a a a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>1</sub> c c c<sub>5</sub> b<sub>1</sub></em>. For specimens see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 281.</p>

<p>The ten-lined tail-rhyme stanza occurs very rarely; we have an example
in Longfellow’s <cite>The Goblet of Life</cite> (p. 114), its formula being <em>a a a
a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em></p>

<p><a name="section243" id="section243"></a>
§ <b>243.</b> We find, however, pretty often&mdash;though only in Modern
English&mdash;certain variant forms of the enlarged eight- and ten-<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_299" id="Pg_299" title="299"></a>lined
tail-rhyme stanzas, the chief verses of which are of unequal length in
each half-stanza; as in Congreve’s poem, <cite>On Miss Temple</cite> (Poets, vii.
568). In this poem the first verse of each half-stanza is shortened by
one foot, in accordance with the formula <em>a<sub>3</sub> a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
   <div class="line">Leave, leave the drawing-room,</div>
   <div class="line">Where flowers of beauty us’d  to bloom;</div>

   <div class="line">The beau, in spite of box and dice,</div>
   <div class="line indent2">Acknowledge, all excels.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Stanzas of cognate form are quoted in <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 283&ndash;5,
constructed according to the schemes: <em>a a<sub>2</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>2</sub> c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>3</sub> b b<sub>4</sub>
c ~<sub>2</sub> a<sub>3</sub> d d<sub>4</sub> c ~<sub>2</sub></em> (with a varying first rhyme in the chief verses), <em>a
a b b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>2</sub> d d e e<sub>4</sub> c<sub>2</sub></em> (ten lines, with a new rhyming couplet in the
half-stanza), <em>a a b b c<sub>3</sub> C<sub>2</sub> a a b b c<sub>3</sub> C<sub>2</sub></em> (an analogous twelve-lined
stanza, extended by refrain in each half-stanza), <em>a b a b<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub> d e d e<sub>5</sub>
c<sub>3</sub></em> (crossed rhymes in the principal verses).</p>

<p>Two uncommon variations that do not, strictly speaking, belong to the
isocolic stanzas, correspond to the formulas <em>a b b<sub>5</sub> c<sub>2</sub> c d d<sub>5</sub> a<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>a b
a<sub>4</sub> c ~<sub>2</sub> b a b<sub>4</sub> c ~<sub>2</sub></em></p>

<p><a name="section244" id="section244"></a>
§ <b>244.</b> Another step in the development of the tail-rhyme stanza
consisted in making the principal verses of the half-stanza shorter than
the tail-verse. Models for this form existed in Low Latin, Provençal,
and Old French poetry (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, i, § 366). In Middle English,
however, there are not many stanzas of this form. We have an example in
Dunbar’s poem <cite>Of the Ladyis Solistaris at Court</cite> (<em>a a<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub> d d<sub>2</sub>
e<sub>3</sub> f f<sub>2</sub> e<sub>3</sub></em>):</p>

<p>The same rhythmical structure is found in the old ballad, <cite>The Notbrowne
Maid</cite>, in Percy’s <cite>Reliques</cite>, vol. ii. In this collection the poem is
printed in twelve-lined stanzas of four- and three-foot verses. Skeat,
however, in his <cite>Specimens of English Literature</cite>, printed it in stanzas
of six long lines.</p>

<p>In either arrangement the relationship of the metre to the Septenary
verse comes clearly out.</p>

<p>In Modern English this stanza is also very popular. It occurs in Scott
(p. 460, <em>a a<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>), Burns (doubled, p. 61, <em>a a<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub> d
d<sub>2</sub> e<sub>3</sub> f f<sub>2</sub> e<sub>3</sub></em>, p. 211, <em>a a<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub> d d<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub> e e<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>).</p>

<p>Often there are also two- and three-foot iambic-anapaestic
verses combined in stanzas of this kind, as in Cowper (p. 427),
Burns (p. 244), &amp;c.</p>

<p>Subordinate varieties of this stanza consisting of other verses are
quoted, with specimens, in <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 286&ndash;8, after the formulas:
<em>a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub>, a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>6</sub> c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>6</sub></em>, <em>a a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c c<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub>, a a<sub>3</sub> b c c b<sub>4</sub></em>,
<em>a a<sub>2</sub> b<sub>4</sub> c c<sub>2</sub> b<sub>4</sub>, a ~ a ~ b ~ b ~ c d ~ d ~ e ~ e ~<sub>2</sub> c<sub>3</sub></em></p>

<p><a name="section245" id="section245"></a>
§ <b>245.</b> A small group of tail-rhyme stanzas consists of those
in which the second chief verses are shorter than the first.</p>

<p>Such a variety occurs in a tail-rhyme stanza of four-foot trochaic
verses, the second verse of each half-stanza being shortened by two
measures. It was used by Donne in his translation of Psalm 137 (<cite>Poets,</cite>
iv, 43):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">By Euphrates’ flow’ry side</div>
    <div class="line">We did ’bide,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">From dear Juda far absented,</div>
    <div class="line">Tearing the air with our cries,</div>
    <div class="line">And our eyes</div>
    <div class="line indent2">With their streams his stream augmented.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The same stanza we find in Longfellow, <cite>Tales of a Wayside Inn</cite>, v (p.
552). Similar stanzas are quoted in <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 289, their schemes
being <em>a<sub>3</sub> a<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>3</sub> c<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub>, a<sub>3</sub> a<sub>2</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub> c<sub>2</sub> b<sub>5</sub>, a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a<sub>4</sub> c<sub>3</sub> c<sub>2</sub></em> (the
tail-rhyme verse put in front)</p>

<p><a name="section246" id="section246"></a>
§ <b>246.</b> There are also some stanzas (<em>a b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>3</sub> a b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>3</sub></em>) which may be
looked upon as modelled on the tail-rhyme stanza; such a stanza we find
in Mrs. Browning’s poem, <cite>A Sabbath morning at Sea</cite> (iii. 74); its
formula being <em>a b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>3</sub> a b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>3</sub></em>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">The ship went on with solemn face:</div>
    <div class="line">To meet the darkness on the deep,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">The solemn ship went onward:</div>
    <div class="line">I bowed down weary in the place,</div>
    <div class="line">For parting tears and present sleep</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Had weighed mine eyelids downward.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_301" id="Pg_301" title="301"></a></p>

<p>Other stanzas of this kind show the scheme: <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a b<sub>2</sub>
c<sub>4</sub> a b<sub>2</sub> c<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>1</sub> a<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>a ~ b a ~ b<sub>4</sub> c ~<sub>6</sub> d ~ e d ~ e<sub>4</sub> c ~<sub>6</sub></em>;
cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 290.</p>

<p>A stanza belonging to this group, and consisting of ten lines rhyming
according to the formula <em>a b a b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>6</sub> d e d e<sub>3</sub> c<sub>6</sub></em>, occurs in M.
Arnold’s <cite>Empedocles on Etna</cite>, p. 446 (printed in stanzas of five
lines)</p>

<p><a name="section247" id="section247"></a>
§ <b>247.</b> Another metre, which was equally popular with the tail-rhyme
stanza with its many varieties, is the stanza formed of two Septenary
verses (catalectic tetrameters). In the Middle English period we find it
used with feminine rhymes only; afterwards, however, there are both
feminine and masculine rhymes, and in modern times the feminine ending
is quite exceptional. This metre, broken up into four lines, is one of
the oldest and most popular of equal-membered stanzas. One of its
forms<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> has in hymn-books the designation of <cite>Common Metre</cite>.</p>

<p>Middle and Modern English specimens of this simple form
have been given above (§§ <a href="#section77">77</a>, <a href="#section78">78</a>, <a href="#section136">136</a>, <a href="#section138">138&ndash;40</a>); in some of
them the verses rhyme and are printed as long lines; in others
the verses rhyme in long lines but are printed as short ones
(<em>a b c b</em>), and in others, again, the verses both rhyme and are
printed as short lines (<em>a b a b</em>).</p>

<p>On the analogy of this stanza, especially of the short-lined rhyming
form, and of the doubled form with intermittent rhyme (which is,
properly speaking, a stanza rhyming in long lines), there have been
developed many new strophic forms. One of the most popular of these is
the stanza consisting alternately of four- and three-foot
iambic-anapaestic verses. In this form is written, e.g. the celebrated
poem of Charles Wolfe, <cite>The Burial of Sir John Moore</cite> (cf. § <a href="#section191">191</a>):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,</div>
    <div class="line">As his corpse to the rampart we hurried;</div>
    <div class="line">Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot</div>
    <div class="line">O’er the grave where our hero we buried.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In other poems there are masculine rhymes only, as in Cowper (p. 429).</p>

<p>Stanzas of this structure, composed of trochaic verses or of trochaic
mixed with iambic or of dactylic mixed with iambic<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_302" id="Pg_302" title="302"></a>-anapaestic verses,
are not frequent. (For examples see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 292.)</p>

<p><a name="section248" id="section248"></a>
§ <b>248.</b> Some other analogical developments from this type, however,
occur pretty often; a stanza of alternate four- and two-foot verses (<em>a<sub>4</sub>
b ~<sub>2</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b ~<sub>2</sub></em>) is used, for example, by Ben Jonson (<cite>Poets</cite>, iv. 545):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Weep with me all you that read</div>
    <div class="line indent2">This little story;</div>
    <div class="line">And know, for whom a tear you shed,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Death’s self is sorry.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Another of five- and four-foot verses (<em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub></em>) occurs in Cowley,
<cite>The long Life</cite> (Poets, v. 264):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Love from Time’s wings hath stol’n the feathers sure,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">He has, and put them to his own,</div>
    <div class="line">For hours, of late, as long as days endure,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">And very minutes hours are grown.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Other less common analogous forms are given in <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 298, the
formulas being <em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>2</sub> b<sub>5</sub> a<sub>2</sub>
b<sub>5</sub></em>.</p>

<p>There are also stanzas of anisometrical verses rhyming in couplets, but
they occur very rarely. An example is Donne’s <cite>The Paradox</cite> (Poets, iv.
397), after the scheme <em>a<sub>5</sub> a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">No lover saith I love, nor any other</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Can judge a perfect lover:</div>
    <div class="line">He thinks that else none can or will agree</div>
    <div class="line indent2">That any loves but he.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a name="section249" id="section249"></a>
§ <b>249.</b> Pretty often we find&mdash;not indeed in middle English, but in
Modern English poetry&mdash;eight-lined (doubled) forms of the different
four-lined stanzas. Only doubled forms, however, of the formula <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub>
a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub></em> are employed with any frequency; they have either
only masculine rhymes or rhymes which vary between masculine and
feminine. An example of the latter kind we have in Drayton’s <cite>To his coy
Love</cite> (Poets, iii. 585):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">I pray thee, love, love me no more,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Call home the heart you gave me,</div>
    <div class="line">I but in vain that saint adore,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">That can, but will not save me:</div>
    <div class="line">These poor half kisses kill me quite;</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Was ever man thus served?</div>
    <div class="line">Amidst an ocean of delight,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">For pleasure to be starved.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_303" id="Pg_303" title="303"></a></p>

<p>Eight-lined stanzas with the following schemes are not common:&mdash;<em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub>
c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>,
<em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a ~<sub>3</sub> b<sub>4</sub> a ~<sub>3</sub> b<sub>4</sub> c ~<sub>3</sub> d<sub>4</sub> c ~<sub>3</sub> d<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub>
b<sub>3</sub> d<sub>4</sub> e<sub>3</sub> f<sub>4</sub> e<sub>3</sub>.</em> Only in the last stanza and in the usual form <em>a b a b
c d c d</em> we find trochaic and iambic-anapaestic verses. An example of
the latter sort which is pretty often met with we have in Cunningham’s
<cite>The Sycamore Shade</cite> (Poets, x. 717):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">T’other day as I sat in the sycamore shade,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Young Damon came whistling along,</div>

    <div class="line indent2">And my heart caper’d  up to my tongue:</div>

    <div class="line">The shepherd’s so civil, you’ve nothing to fear,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Then prythee, fond urchin, lie still.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>For specimens of the other subordinate varieties and of the rare
twelve-lined stanza (<em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> d<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> e<sub>4</sub> f<sub>3</sub> d<sub>4</sub> f<sub>3</sub> g<sub>4</sub> f<sub>3</sub></em> and <em>a<sub>4</sub> b ~<sub>3</sub>

<p><a name="section250" id="section250"></a>
§ <b>250.</b> There are also doubled forms of the before-mentioned analogical
development of the Septenary, the schemes of which are as follows:</p>

<p><em>a<sub>4</sub> b ~<sub>2</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b ~<sub>2</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b ~<sub>2</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b ~<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>3</sub> b ~<sub>2</sub> a<sub>3</sub> b ~<sub>2</sub> c<sub>3</sub> d ~<sub>2</sub> c<sub>3</sub> d ~<sub>2</sub></em>,
<em>a ~<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a ~<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c ~<sub>2</sub> d<sub>3</sub> c ~<sub>2</sub> d<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a ~<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> a ~<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c ~<sub>4</sub> d<sub>5</sub> c ~<sub>4</sub> d<sub>5</sub></em>,
and <em>a<sub>5</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>5</sub> d<sub>4</sub></em>.</p>

<p>We must here refer to some eight-lined stanzas which have this common
feature that the two half-stanzas are exactly alike, but the
half-stanzas themselves consist of unequal members. These, however, will
be treated in the next chapter.</p>

<p>In this connexion may be also mentioned the doubled <cite>Poulter’s Measure</cite>,
which occurs somewhat frequently, as in <cite>Hymns Ancient and Modern</cite>, No.
149:</p>

<p>The same form of stanza was used in Hood’s well-known <cite>Song of the
Shirt</cite> (p. 183).</p>

<p>Other stanzas of similar structure are given with specimens in <cite>Metrik</cite>,
ii, §§ 300, 301; their formulas are <em>a<sub>4</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>2</sub> d<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a b a<sub>4</sub>

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="subtitle">ONE-RHYMED INDIVISIBLE AND BIPARTITE
  UNEQUAL-MEMBERED STANZAS</span></h3>


<p><a name="section251" id="section251"></a>
§ <b>251.</b> These different kinds of stanzas may be conveniently treated
together, since they are closely allied with each other, in that both of
them&mdash;the indivisible stanzas usually, and the bipartite
unequal-membered stanzas frequently&mdash;exhibit a one-rhymed principal
part.</p>


<h4>I. <em>One-rhymed and indivisible stanzas.</em></h4>

<p>The <b>one-rhymed stanzas</b>, taken as a whole, cannot without qualification
be ranged under any of the other kinds of stanza. The four-lined and
eight-lined stanzas of this form, it is true, do for the most part seem
to belong so far as their syntactical structure is concerned to the
bipartite, equal-membered class (<em>a a, a a; a a a a, a a a a</em>). But
those of six lines may belong either to the bipartite (<em>a a a, a a a</em>)
or to the tripartite class (<em>a a, a a, a a</em>). It is even more difficult
to draw a sharp line of distinction when the strophes have an odd number
of lines.</p>

<p>In no case is there such a definite demarcation between the chief parts
in these one-rhymed stanzas as exists in stanzas with varied rhymes,
whether based upon crossed rhymes or on rhyming couplets.

<b>Three-lined stanzas</b> of the same structure as the four-lined stanzas to
be described in the next section were not used before the Modern period.
They occur pretty often, and are constructed of widely different kinds
of verse; in Drayton’s <cite>The Heart</cite> (Poets, iii. 580) three-foot lines
are used:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">If thus we needs must go,</div>
    <div class="line">What shall our one heart do,</div>
    <div class="line">This one made of our two?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Stanzas of this kind, consisting of three-foot trochaic and dactylic
verses, as well as stanzas of four-foot iambic, iambic-<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_306" id="Pg_306" title="306"></a>anapaestic,
trochaic, and dactylic verses, are also met with in the Modern period.
Even more popular, however, are those of five-foot iambic verses, as e.
g. in Dryden, pp. 393, 400, &amp;c. Stanzas of longer verses, on the other
hand, e.g. six-foot dactylic, seven-foot trochaic, iambic, or
iambic-anapaestic and eight-foot trochaic verses, occur only
occasionally in the more recent poets, e.g. Tennyson, Swinburne, R.
Browning, D.G. Rossetti, &amp;c. (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 303&ndash;4).</p>

<p>Some other Modern English anisometrical stanzas may also be mentioned,
as one in Cowley with the formula <em>a<sub>5</sub> a<sub>4</sub> a<sub>5</sub></em> in <cite>Love’s Visibility</cite>
(Poets, v. 273):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">With much of pain, and all the art I knew</div>
    <div class="line">Have I endeavour’d  hitherto</div>
    <div class="line">To hide my love, and yet all will not do.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>For other forms see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 305.</p>

<p><a name="section252" id="section252"></a>
§ <b>252. Four-lined, one-rhymed stanzas</b> of four-foot verses (used in Low
Latin, Provençal and Old French poetry, cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, i, p. 369) are
early met with in Middle English poems, as in Wright’s <cite>Spec. of Lyr.
Poetry</cite>, pp. 57 and 68.</p>

<p>The first begins with these verses, which happen to show a prevailing
trochaic rhythm.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="line">Suete iesu, king of blysse,</div>
      <div class="line">Myn huerte loue, min huerte lisse,</div>
      <div class="line">Þou art suete myd ywisse,</div>
      <div class="line">Wo is him þat þe shall misse.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="line">Suete iesu, myn huerte lyht,</div>
      <div class="line">Þou art day withoute nyht;</div>
      <div class="line">Þou ȝeue me streinþe ant eke myht,</div>
      <div class="line">Forte louien þe aryht.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This simple form of stanza is also found in Modern English poetry;
apparently, however, only in one of the earliest poets, viz. Wyatt (p.
36).</p>

<p>It occurs also in Middle English, consisting of four-stressed,
rhyming-alliterative long-lines, as e.g. in Wright’s <cite>Spec. of Lyr.
Poetry</cite>, p. 237; and of simple four-stressed long lines in Wyatt (p.
147), and Burns (pp. 253, 265, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>In Middle English poetry Septenary verses are often used in this way on
the Low Latin model (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, i, pp. 90, 91, 370), as well as
Septenary-Alexandrine verses, e.g. Wright’s <cite>Spec. of Lyr. Poetry</cite>, p.
93:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_307" id="Pg_307" title="307"></a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Blessed be þou, leuedy, ful of heouene blisse,</div>
    <div class="line">Suete flur of parays, moder of mildenesse,</div>
    <div class="line">Preyȝe iesu, þy sone, þat he me rede and wysse</div>
    <div class="line">So my wey forte gon, þat he me neuer misse.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In Modern English stanzas of this kind, consisting of Septenary verses,
are of rare occurrence. We have an example in Leigh Hunt’s <cite>The jovial
Priest’s Confession</cite> (p. 338), a translation of the well-known poem
ascribed to Walter Map, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mihi est propositum in taberna mori</cite> (cf. §§
135, 182).</p>

<p>Shorter verses, e.g. iambic lines of three measures, are also very
rarely used for such stanzas; e.g. in Donne and Denham (<cite>Poets</cite>, iv. 48
and v. 611)</p>

<p><a name="section253" id="section253"></a>
§ <b>253.</b> A small group of other stanzas connected with the above may be
called <b>indivisible stanzas</b>. They consist of a one-rhymed main part
mostly of three, more rarely of two or four lines, followed by a shorter
refrain-verse, a <em>cauda</em>, as it were, but in itself too unimportant to
lend a bipartite character to the stanza. Otherwise, stanzas like these
might be looked upon as bipartite unequal-membered stanzas, with which,
indeed, they stand in close relationship. Three-lined stanzas of this
kind occur in Modern English only; as e.g. a stanza consisting of an
heroic couplet and a two-foot refrain verse of different rhythm: <em>a a<sub>5</sub>
B<sub>2</sub></em> in Moore’s Song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
     <div class="line">Oh! where are they, who heard in former hours,</div>
     <div class="line">The voice of song in these neglected bowers?</div>
     <div class="line indent2">They are gone&mdash;all gone!</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Other stanzas show the formulas <em>a a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em> and <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>. Their structure
evidently is analogous to that of a four-lined Middle English stanza <em>a
a a<sub>4</sub> B<sub>3</sub></em>, the model of which we find in Low Latin and Provençal poetry
(cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, i. 373) and in Furnivall’s <cite>Political, Religious, and
Love Poems</cite>, p. 4:</p>

<p>Similar stanzas occur also in Modern English poets: <em>a a a<sub>4</sub> B<sub>2</sub></em> in
Wyatt, p. 99, <em>a a a<sub>5</sub> B<sub>3</sub></em> in G. Herbert, p. 18, &amp;c. We find others with
the formula <em>a a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em> in Dunbar’s <cite>Inconstancy of Love</cite>, and
with the formula <em>a a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> d d d<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>, in Dorset (<cite>Poets</cite>,<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_308" id="Pg_308" title="308"></a>
vi. 512); there are also stanzas of five lines, e.g. <em>a a a a<sub>4</sub> B<sub>2</sub></em>
(Wyatt, p. 80).</p>

<p>An older poem in Ritson’s <cite>Anc. Songs</cite>, i. 140 (<cite>Welcom Yol</cite>), has the
same metre and form of stanza, but with a refrain verse of two measures
and a two-lined refrain prefixed to the first stanza: <em>A B<sub>4</sub>  a a a<sub>4</sub> B<sub>2</sub>
c c c<sub>4</sub> B<sub>2</sub></em>. A similar extended stanza is found in Wyatt (p. 108) <em>A<sub>3</sub>
b b b<sub>3</sub> A<sub>3</sub> B<sub>2</sub></em>; <em>A<sub>3</sub> c c c<sub>3</sub> A<sub>3</sub> B<sub>2</sub></em>. There are also in modern poetry
similar isometrical stanzas, as in Swinburne (<cite>Poems</cite>, ii. 108) on the
scheme <em>a a a b<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>c c c b<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>d d d b<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>e e e f<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>g g g f<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>h h
h f<sub>5</sub></em>; in Campbell (p. 73) <em>a a a b<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>c c c b<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>d d d b<sub>4</sub></em>; and in M.
Arnold, <cite>The Second Best</cite> (p. 49), with feminine endings in the main
part of the stanza, <em>a ~ a ~ a ~ b<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>c ~ c ~ c ~ b<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>d ~ d ~ d ~
b<sub>4</sub></em>, &amp;c.</p>


<h4>II. <em>Bipartite unequal-membered isometrical stanzas.</em></h4>

<p><a name="section254" id="section254"></a>
§ <b>254.</b> These are of greater number and variety. The shortest of them,
however, viz. <b>stanzas of four lines</b>, are found only in Modern English;
first of all, stanzas arranged according to the formula <em>a a b a</em>; in
this case <em>b</em> can be used as refrain also, as in Sidney, <cite>Astrophel and
Stella</cite>, Song I (Grosart, i. 75):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
     <div class="line">Doubt you to whom my Muse these notes entendeth,</div>
     <div class="line">Which now my breast, surcharg’d  to musick lendeth!</div>
     <div class="line indent2">To you, to you, all song of praise is due,</div>
     <div class="line">Only in you my song begins and endeth.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Similar stanzas of four-foot iambic and of two-foot iambic-anapaestic
lines occur in Tennyson, <cite>The Daisy</cite> (p. 270), and in Longfellow, <cite>King
Olaf and Earl Sigwald</cite> (p. 573).</p>

<p>Stanzas with the scheme <em>a b b a</em> also belong to this group, the two
halves not being exactly equal, but only similar to each other on
account of the unequal arrangement of rhymes.</p>

<p>Such a stanza of four-foot iambic verses occurs in an elegy of Ben
Jonson’s (<cite>Poets</cite>, iv. 571):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
     <div class="line">Though beauty be the mark of praise,</div>
     <div class="line indent2">And yours of whom I sing be such,</div>
     <div class="line indent2">As not the world can praise too much,</div>
     <div class="line">Yet is’t your virtue now I raise.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>and notably in Tennyson’s <cite>In Memoriam</cite>. Both this stanza and the
similar stanza of trochaic verses are found pretty often (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>,
ii, § 311)</p>

<p><a name="section255" id="section255"></a>
§ <b>255.</b> More frequently <b>five-lined stanzas</b> occur. One on the scheme
<em>a b b a a<sub>4</sub></em>, similar to that just mentioned, is used<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_309" id="Pg_309" title="309"></a> in Sidney, <cite>Psalm
XXVIII</cite>; others, composed in various metres, have a one-rhymed <em>frons</em>
or <em>cauda</em>, e.g. <em>a a a b b<sub>3</sub></em> in Wyatt, p. 128, <em>a a b b b<sub>4</sub></em> in Moore
(<cite>Still when Daylight</cite>) and other poets. Of greater importance are some
stanzas on the formula <em>a a b a b</em>; they may be looked upon as
isometrical tail-rhyme-stanzas, shortened by one chief verse; as <em>a a b
a B<sub>4</sub></em>, often occurring in Dunbar, e.g. in <cite>The Devil’s Inquest</cite>, and
in Wyatt, p. 29:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
     <div class="line">My lute awake, perform the last</div>
     <div class="line">Labour, that thou and I shall waste,</div>
     <div class="line indent2">And end that I have now begun;</div>
     <div class="line">And when this song is sung and past,</div>
     <div class="line indent2">My lute! be still, for I have done.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Another form of this stanza, consisting of five-foot lines with refrain,
occurs in Swinburne, <cite>In an Orchard</cite> (<cite>Poems</cite>, i. 116), and a variety
consisting of three-foot verses is found in Drayton’s <cite>Ode to Himself</cite>
(Poets, iii, p. 587). More frequently this stanza is found with the two
parts in inverted order (<em>a b a a b<sub>4</sub></em>), as in Moore:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
     <div class="line">Take back the sigh, thy lips of art</div>
     <div class="line indent2">In passion’s moment breath’d  to me:</div>
     <div class="line">Yet, no&mdash;it must not, will not part,</div>
     <div class="line">’Tis now the life-breath of my heart,</div>
     <div class="line indent2">And has become too pure for thee.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>There are also five-foot iambic and three-foot iambic-anapaestic and
other lines connected in this way, as in G. Herbert (p. 82); in
Longfellow, <cite>Enceladus</cite> (p. 595); on the scheme <em>a b c c b<sub>3</sub></em> in
Wordsworth, i. 248; and in R. Browning according to the formula <em>a b c c
b<sub>4</sub></em> (vi. 77). The allied form of stanza, <em>a a b b a</em>, probably
originating by inversion of the two last verses of the former stanza (<em>a
a b a b</em>), occurs in Middle English in the poem <cite>Of the Cuckoo and the
Nightingale</cite><span class="locked">.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_310" id="Pg_310" title="310"></a></p>

<p>The same stanza, both of four- and five-foot lines, is frequently
employed by Dunbar; e.g. <cite>On his Heid-Ake, The Visitation of St.
Francis</cite>, &amp;c. We find it also in modern poets, composed of the same, or
of other verses; Moore, e.g., has used it with five-foot
iambic-anapaestic lines, in <cite>At the mid hour of Night</cite>.</p>

<p>A stanza on the model <em>a b a b b</em> is a favourite in Modern English; it
is formed from the four-lined stanza (<em>a b a b</em>) by repeating the last
rhyme. It consists of the most different kinds of verse; an example is
Carew’s <cite>To my inconstant Mistress</cite> (Poets, iii. 678):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">When thou, poor excommunicate</div>
    <div class="line indent2">From all the joys of love, shall see</div>
    <div class="line">The full reward, and glorious fate,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Which my strong faith shall purchase me,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Then curse thine own inconstancy.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>For other specimens in lines of five, three, and four feet see <cite>Metrik</cite>,
ii. 307.</p>

<p>Much less common is the form <em>a b b a b</em>, which occurs e.g. in
Coleridge’s <cite>Recollections of Love</cite> (<em>a b b a b<sub>4</sub></em>).</p>

<p>Five-lined stanzas of crossed rhymes are not very rare; an example of
the form <em>a b a b a<sub>4</sub></em> is found in R. Browning’s <cite>The Patriot</cite> (iv. 149):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">It was roses, roses, all the way,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">With myrtle mixed in my path like mad:</div>
    <div class="line">The house-roofs seemed to heave and sway,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">The church-spires flamed, such flags they had,</div>
    <div class="line">A year ago on this very day.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>For specimens of other forms see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 318</p>

<p><a name="section256" id="section256"></a>
§ <b>256.</b> The simplest kind of isometrical stanzas of this group is that
in which the four-lined one-rhymed stanza is extended by the addition of
a couplet with a new rhyme, so that it forms a <b>six-lined stanza</b>. A
Latin stanza of this kind consisting of Septenary verses is given in
Wright’s <cite>Pol. Poems</cite>, i. 253, and a Middle English imitation of it, ib.
p. 268, in the poem <cite>On the Minorite Friars</cite>. The same stanza composed
of four-stressed verses is used by Minot in his poem <cite>Of the batayl of
Banocburn</cite> (ib. i. 61):</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_311" id="Pg_311" title="311"></a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Skottes out of Berwik and of Abirdene,</div>
    <div class="line">At the Bannok burn war ȝe to kene;</div>
    <div class="line">Thare slogh ȝe many sakles, als it was sene;</div>
    <div class="line">And now has king Edward wroken it, I wene.</div>
    <div class="line indent2">It es wrokin, I wene, wele wurth the while;</div>
    <div class="line indent2">War ȝit with the Skottes, for thai er ful of gile.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Here the <em>frons</em> is connected with the <em>cauda</em>, which recurs in each
stanza as a kind of refrain, by means of <em>concatenatio</em>. Two other poems
of Minot’s (v, ix) are written in similar stanzas of six and eight
lines. In the ten-lined stanza of the poem in Wright’s <cite>Spec. of Lyr.
Poetry</cite>, p. 25, which is of similar structure, we find the doubling of
the <em>frons</em>.</p>

<p>A six-lined stanza of this kind, which has the formula <em>a a a b B B</em> (<em>B
B</em> being refrain-verses), is used by Dunbar in his <cite>Gray-Horse</cite> poem and
in <cite>Luve Erdly and Divine</cite>. The latter begins:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Now culit is Dame Venus brand;</div>
    <div class="line">Trew Luvis fyre is ay kindilland,</div>

    <div class="line">In feynit luve quhat foly bene;</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Now cumis Aige quhair Yowth hes bene,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">And true Luve rysis fro the splene.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The same kind of stanza occurs in Wyatt, p. 137. Other forms are: <em>a a b
a b b<sub>5</sub></em>, in Wyatt, p. 71; <em>a b c c b a<sub>4</sub></em> in John Scott, <cite>Conclusion</cite>
(Poets, ix. 773); <em>a b c b c a<sub>4</sub></em> in Tennyson, <cite>A Character</cite> (p. 12):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">With a half-glance upon the sky</div>
    <div class="line">At night he said, ‘The wanderings</div>

    <div class="line">Teach me the nothingness of things.’</div>
    <div class="line">Yet could not all creation pierce</div>
    <div class="line">Beyond the bottom of his eye.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Longer isometrical stanzas are unfrequent, and need hardly be mentioned
here (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, p. 556).</p>


<h4>III. <em>Bipartite unequal-membered anisometrical stanzas.</em></h4>

<p><a name="section257" id="section257"></a>
§ <b>257. Two-lined and four-lined stanzas.</b> The shortest stanzas of this
kind consist of two anisometrical lines, rhyming in couplets, e.g. four-
and five-foot, five- and three-foot lines, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_312" id="Pg_312" title="312"></a></p>

<p>These have been mentioned before (§ <a href="#section207">207</a>); but as a rule they are used,
like the heroic couplet, in continuous systems only, without strophic
arrangement.</p>

<p>The <cite>Poulter’s Measure</cite> (§§ <a href="#section146">146</a>, <a href="#section206">206</a>) must be mentioned in this place.
This metre, also, is in narrative poetry employed without strophic
arrangement; but in lyrical poetry it is sometimes written in stanzas.
In this case it is mostly printed as a stanza of four lines, even when
rhyming in long lines, i.e. with intermittent rhyme (<em>a b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>);
e.g. in Tennyson, <cite>Marriage Morning</cite> (p. 285):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Light, so low upon earth,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">You send a flash to the sun,</div>
    <div class="line">Here is the golden close of love,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">All my wooing is done.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The division into stanzas is still more distinctly recognizable when
there are crossed rhymes (<em>a b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>), as e.g. in a song in Percy’s
<cite>Reliques</cite>, <span class="fakesc">I.</span> ii. 2, <cite>The Aged Lover renounceth Love</cite> (quoted by the
grave-digger in Shakespeare’s <cite>Hamlet</cite>):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">I lothe that I did love,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">In youth that I thought swete,</div>
    <div class="line">As time requires: for my behove</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Me thinkes they are not mete.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This stanza occurs very frequently (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 321), but is
rarely formed of trochaic verses.</p>

<p>Another rare variety on the scheme <em>a ~ b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em> is found in Mrs.
Hemans, <cite>The Stream is free</cite> (vii. 42), and in M. Arnold’s <cite>The Neckan</cite>
(p. 167).</p>

<p>Similar to the common <cite>Poulter’s Measure</cite> stanza is another stanza of
iambic-anapaestic verses on the formula <em>a a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>3</sub></em> (in <em>b</em>
middle-rhyme is used, so that the scheme may also be given as <em>a a<sub>3</sub> b b<sub>2</sub>
a<sub>3</sub></em>.)We find it in Burns, the <em>a</em>-rhymes being masculine (p. 245) and
feminine (p. 218).</p>

<p>Four-lined stanzas of two rhyming couplets of unequal length are fairly
common; as e.g. on the model <em>a a<sub>5</sub> b b<sub>4</sub></em> in Dryden, <cite>Hymn for St.
John’s Eve</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">O sylvan prophet!  whose eternal fame</div>
    <div class="line">Echoes from Judah’s hills and Jordan’s stream,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">The music of our numbers raise,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">And tune our voices to thy praise.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_313" id="Pg_313" title="313"></a></p>

<p>Other schemes that occur are <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b b<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a a b<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a a b<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>a
a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>4</sub> a<sub>2</sub> b b<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>5</sub> a<sub>3</sub> b b<sub>5</sub></em>; there are even forms with lines
of unequal length in each part, as e.g.: <em>a<sub>4</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>7</sub> b<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>7</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> b<sub>6</sub></em>,
<em>a<sub>5</sub> a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>5</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>4</sub> b<sub>6</sub></em>. For examples see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii (§§ 322&ndash;4).</p>

<p>Enclosing rhymes are also found; and in this case the lines of the same
length usually rhyme together, as in the formula <em>a<sub>3</sub> b b<sub>5</sub> a<sub>3</sub></em> in Mrs.
Hemans, <cite>The Song of Night</cite> (vi. 94):</p>

 <div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line indent2">I come to thee, O Earth!</div>
    <div class="line">With all my gifts!&mdash;for every flower sweet dew</div>
    <div class="line">In bell, and urn, and chalice, to renew</div>
    <div class="line indent2">The glory of its birth.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes verses are used partly of unequal length: <em>a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub></em> in M.
Arnold, <cite>A Nameless Epitaph</cite> (p. 232), or <em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>2</sub> b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a b b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>3</sub></em>,
&amp;c. (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 325)</p>

<p><a name="section258" id="section258"></a>
§ <b>258.</b> Stanzas of this kind frequently occur with crossed rhymes. Most
commonly two longer verses are placed between two shorter ones, or vice
versa; thus we have the formula <em>a<sub>3</sub> b a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em> in Southey’s <cite>The Ebb-Tide</cite>
(ii. 193):</p>

 <div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line indent2">Slowly thy flowing tide</div>
    <div class="line">Came in, old Avon! scarcely did mine eyes,</div>
    <div class="line">As watchfully I roam’d  thy green-wood side,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Perceive its gentle rise.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Other forms are <em>a<sub>2</sub> b a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>4</sub> b a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>5</sub> b a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub></em> (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>,
ii, § 326).</p>

<p>Three isometrical verses and one shorter or longer end-verse can also be
so connected, as e.g. on the scheme <em>a b a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em> in Pope, <cite>Ode on
Solitude</cite> (p. 45):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Happy the man whose wish and care</div>
    <div class="line">A few paternal acres bound,</div>
    <div class="line">Content to breathe his native air,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">In his own ground;</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>or in Cowper on the model <em>a b a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub></em> in <cite>Divine Love endures no Rival</cite>
(p. 418):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line indent2">Love is the Lord whom I obey,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Whose will transported I perform;</div>
    <div class="line indent2">The centre of my rest, my stay,</div>
    <div class="line">Love’s all in all to me, myself a worm.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Similar stanzas both with this and other arrangements of rhymes (as e.
g. <em>a b a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a b a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>a b a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub></em>) are very popular.<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_314" id="Pg_314" title="314"></a> A specimen
of the first of these formulas is found in M. Arnold’s <cite>Progress</cite> (p.
252), and one of the second in his <cite>A Southern Night</cite> (p. 294). For
other examples see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 326&ndash;7.</p>

<p>More rarely a short verse begins the stanza (e.g. <em>a<sub>3</sub> b a b<sub>5</sub></em> in
Mrs. Hemans, <cite>The Wish</cite>, vi. 249), or is placed in the middle on the
scheme <em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a b<sub>5</sub></em> (as in G. Herbert, <cite>Church Lock and Key</cite>,
p. 61). For specimens see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 328, 329.</p>

<p>Stanzas of one isometrical and another anisometrical half are not
frequently met with; a specimen of the form <em>a b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em> is
found in G. Herbert’s <cite>Employment</cite> (p. 51).</p>

<p>More common are stanzas of two anisometrical halves; in this case either
the two middle or the isolated verses are generally isometrical; e.g. on
the scheme <em>a<sub>5</sub> b a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em> in G. Herbert, <cite>The Temper</cite> (p. 49):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

    <div class="line indent6">My soul might ever feel!</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>or on <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub></em> in Milton, <cite>Psalm V</cite> (vol. iii, p. 24):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

    <div class="line">My king and God, for unto thee I pray.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Stanzas like these are very much in vogue, and may be composed of the
most varied forms of verse (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii; § 330)</p>

<p><a name="section259" id="section259"></a>
§ <b>259.</b> Among the <b>five-lined stanzas</b> the first place must be given to
those in which the arrangement of rhymes is parallel, as these are found
in Middle English as well as in Modern English poetry. A stanza of form
<em>a a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> b<sub>6</sub></em> occurs in Wright’s <cite>Spec. of Lyr. Poetry</cite>, p. 60:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

  </div>
</div>

<p>A similar structure (<em>a a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub></em>) is shown in a stanza of a poem
quoted by Ritson, <cite>Ancient Songs</cite>, i. 129; the poem belongs to the
fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Still more numerous are these stanzas in Modern English;<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_315" id="Pg_315" title="315"></a> e.g. the form
<em>a a a<sub>3</sub> b b<sub>5</sub></em> occurs in Herbert, <cite>Sinne</cite> (p. 58), <em>a a a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em> in
Shelley (iii. 244), <em>a a a b<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub></em> in Suckling (<cite>Poets</cite>, iii. 734); a
still more irregular structure (<em>a<sub>4</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b b<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub></em>) in Cowley, <cite>All for
love</cite> (Poets, v. 263):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

    <div class="line">Whose short liv’d  passions with themselves can die;</div>

    <div class="line indent4">’Midst all his ills, a time does know</div>
   <div class="line">(Though ne’er so long) when he shall not be so.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Here again we meet with the stanzas mentioned above, which are partially
characterized by enclosing rhymes, e.g. corresponding to the formula <em>a
b b a</em>, as in M. Arnold, <cite>On the Rhine</cite> (p. 223), or on the scheme <em>a a
b b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>5</sub></em>, as in Byron, <cite>Oh! snatch’d  away</cite>, &amp;c. (<ins class="correction" title="read: p. 78">p. 123</ins><a name="errata_5" id="errata_5"></a>):</p>

<p>For other stanzas on the formulas <em>a a<sub>5</sub> b b<sub>4</sub> A<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>5</sub> b b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>5</sub> a<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>3</sub> b
b<sub>2</sub> a a<sub>3</sub></em>, &amp;c., see <cite>Metrik</cite> (ii, §§ 332, 333).</p>

<p>In others the chief part of the stanza shows crossed rhyme, as e.g. on
the scheme <em>a b a b<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em> in Poe, <cite>To Helen</cite> (p. 205):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

  </div>
</div>

<p>Other stanzas take the forms <em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub>
a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em>, &amp;c. More uncommon are such forms as <em>a<sub>3</sub> b b<sub>5</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub>, a b<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a
b<sub>5</sub></em>, &amp;c. (For specimens see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 334.)</p>

<p>Stanzas with crossed rhymes throughout, on the other hand, are very
frequent, as e.g. type <em>a b a b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>3</sub></em> in R. Browning’s <cite>By the Fireside</cite>
(iii. 170):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_316" id="Pg_316" title="316"></a></p>

<p>There are many other forms, sometimes very complicated, as e.g. <em>a b a
b<sub>5</sub> a<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a b<sub>5</sub> a<sub>2</sub> b a<sub>6</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>3</sub> b a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>5</sub></em>, &amp;c. (For examples see <cite>Metrik</cite>,
ii, § 335.)</p>

<p><a name="section260" id="section260"></a>
§ <b>260.</b> The tail-rhyme stanzas shortened by one verse occupy an
important position among the five-lined stanzas.</p>

<p>These curtailed forms occur as early as the Middle English period, e.g.
in an envoi on the model <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em>, forming the conclusion of a
poem in six-lined stanzas (<em>a a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em>), printed in Wright’s
<cite>Spec. of Lyr. Poetry</cite>, p. 38.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Ich wolde ich were a þrestelcok,</div>
    <div class="line">A bountyng oþer a lauerok.</div>
    <div class="line indent4">Swete bryd!</div>
    <div class="line">Bituene hire curtel ant hire smok</div>
    <div class="line indent4">Y wolde ben hyd.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In Modern English the common form of stanza is much employed, consisting
of four- and three-foot verses, <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>; there are many
varieties of this scheme, as <em>a a b a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>5</sub> a b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a a<sub>2</sub> b a<sub>4</sub>
b<sub>3</sub></em>, &amp;c. (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 336).</p>

<p>A similar form, with shortening in the first half-stanza, also occurs in
Middle English poetry, though only as an envoi of another form of
stanza, viz, in the <cite>Towneley Mysteries</cite> (pp. 34&ndash;323):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Vnwunne haueþ myn wonges wet,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Þat makeþ me rouþes rede;</div>
    <div class="line">Ne sem i nout þer y am set,</div>
    <div class="line">Þer me calleþ me fule flet</div>
    <div class="line indent2">And waynoun! wayteglede.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This stanza is also frequently used in Modern English, e.g. by Thomas
Moore, <cite>Nay, do not weep</cite>.</p>

<p>A similar stanza on the model <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em> is used by Moore in <cite>Echo</cite>
(ii. 211):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">How sweet the answer Echo makes</div>
    <div class="line indent2">To music at night,</div>
    <div class="line">When, roused by lute or horn, she wakes,</div>
    <div class="line">And far away, o’er lawns and lakes,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Goes answering light.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>We find specimens of this stanza consisting of other metres and of
different structure (isometrical in the first half-stanza),<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_317" id="Pg_317" title="317"></a> e.g. on
the schemes <em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a b a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>, &amp;c. (For specimens see
<cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 337.)</p>

<p>Stanzas of this kind are also formed with three rhymes, e.g. <em>a b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>2</sub>
b<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a ~ b<sub>4</sub> c ~ c ~<sub>2</sub> b<sub>4</sub></em>, &amp;c. (For specimens cf.
<cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 338.)</p>

<p>Another class of shortened tail-rhyme stanzas, which is deficient not in
one of the rhyming couplets, but in one of the tail-verses, comes in
here. Omission of the first tail-verse, producing a stanza on the scheme
<em>a a b b c</em>, occurs in Wordsworth, <cite>The Blind Highland Boy</cite> (ii. 368):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Now we are tired of boisterous joy,</div>
    <div class="line">Have romped enough, my little Boy!</div>
    <div class="line">Jane hangs her head upon my breast,</div>
    <div class="line">And you shall bring your stool and rest;</div>
    <div class="line indent4">This corner is your own.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Another stanza, which is used in Carew’s <cite>Love’s Courtship</cite> (Poets, iii.
707), is formed on the scheme <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c c<sub>4</sub></em>, where the tail-verse of
the second half-stanza is wanting. As to the other varieties, arising
from the use of other metres, cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 338.</p>

<p>Sometimes stanzas of three rhymes occur, rhyming crosswise throughout,
and of various forms, e.g. <em>a b a c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em> in Longfellow, <cite>The Saga of
King Olaf</cite> (p. 565); <em>a b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> c<sub>2</sub></em> in Coleridge; <em>a b a b<sub>5</sub> C<sub>3</sub></em> in
Mrs. Hemans (iv. 119); <em>a b a b<sub>4</sub> C<sub>3</sub></em> in Moore, <cite>Weep, Children of
Israel</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line ital">Weep, weep for him, the Man of God&mdash;</div>
    <div class="line ital indent2">In yonder vale he sunk to rest;</div>

    <div class="line ital">That flowers above his sacred breast.</div>
    <div class="line ital indent2">Weep, children of Israel, weep!</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>For other varieties see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 339</p>

<p><a name="section261" id="section261"></a>
§ <b>261.</b> Unequal-membered anisometrical <b>stanzas of six lines</b> are only
rarely met with in Middle English, as e.g. <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b b b a<sub>2</sub></em> in Dunbar’s
poem, <cite>Aganis Treason</cite>.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_318" id="Pg_318" title="318"></a></p>

<p>They occur, on the other hand, very frequently in Modern English,
especially with parallel rhymes on the scheme <em>a a a a<sub>4</sub> B C<sub>2</sub></em> in <cite>The
Old and Young Courtier</cite> (Percy’s <cite>Rel.</cite> <span class="fakesc">II.</span> iii. 8):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">An old song made by an aged-old pate,</div>
    <div class="line">Of an old worshipful gentleman, who had a greate estate,</div>
    <div class="line">That kept a brave old house at a bountiful rate,</div>
    <div class="line">And an old porter to relieve the poor at his gate;</div>
    <div class="line indent4">Like an old courtier of the queen’s,</div>
    <div class="line indent4">And the queen’s old courtier.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>For specimens of other stanzas, the rhymes of which are arranged in a
similar way (according to <em>a<sub>5</sub> a a b b<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub></em>, or with partly enclosing
rhymes, as <em>a<sub>5</sub> b b b b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a a b b b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b b b a<sub>2</sub></em>, &amp;c.), see
<cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 340.</p>

<p>Forms based upon the tail-rhyme stanza are very popular; of great
importance is the entwined form on a Provençal model (cf. Bartsch,
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Provenzalisches Lesebuch</cite>, p. 46) which was imitated in Middle English
poetry. It corresponds to the scheme <em>a a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em> and gives the
impression, according to Wolf in his book, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Über die Lais</cite>, &amp;c., p. 230,
note 67, that the second part of a common tail-rhyme stanza is inserted
into the first, though it is also possible that it may have been formed
from the extended tail-rhyme stanza <em>a a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em> by shortening
the second part by two chief verses. The first stanza of a poem in
Wright’s <cite>Spec. of Lyr. Poetry</cite>, p. 94, may serve as a specimen:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Ase y me rod þis ender day,</div>
    <div class="line">By grene wode to seche play,</div>

    <div class="line">Lyþe, and ich ou telle may</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Al of þat suete þinge.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This stanza occurs frequently in the <cite>Towneley Mysteries</cite>, pp. 120&ndash;34,
254&ndash;69, &amp;c. In Modern English, however, we find it very seldom; as an
example (iambic-anapaestic verses of four and three measures) we may
refer to Campbell’s <cite>Stanzas on the battle of Navarino</cite> (p. 176).</p>

<p>More frequent in Modern English, on the other hand, is a variety of this
stanza with two-foot tail-verses on the scheme <em>a a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em>; it is
especially common in Ramsay and Fergusson, and occurs in several poems
of Burns, e.g. in his <cite>Scotch Drink</cite> (p. 6):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Let other Poets raise a fracas</div>
    <div class="line">’Bout vines, an’  wines, an’ drunken Bacchus,</div>
    <div class="line">An’ crabbit names an’ stories wrack us,</div>
    <div class="line indent4">An’ grate our lug,</div>
    <div class="line">I sing the juice Scotch bear can mak us,</div>
    <div class="line indent4">In glass or jug.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_319" id="Pg_319" title="319"></a></p>

<p>The same form of stanza is used by Wordsworth and by M. Arnold in his
poem <cite>Kaiser Dead</cite> (p. 495).</p>

<p>The same stanza sometimes occurs with the order of the parts inverted
like <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>, e.g. in Longfellow’s <cite>Voices of the Night</cite> (p.
40).</p>

<p>Other unequal-membered varieties of the anisometrical tail-rhyme stanza
correspond to <em>a a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> a a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>6</sub></em> (cf. the chapter on the Spenserian
stanza and its imitations), <em>a a b c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em> (M. Arnold, <em>Horatian Echo</em>,
p. 47), <em>a a b c c<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>5</sub> a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c c b<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>4</sub> a<sub>2</sub> b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>2</sub> c<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub>
a c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em> (entwined <em>frons</em>), <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>3</sub> b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub></em> (entwined <em>cauda</em>).</p>

<p>For examples see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 343.</p>

<p>Here again we must mention stanzas which in their structure are
influenced by the tail-rhyme stanza and are formed on the scheme <em>a b c
a b c</em>; of these we have several examples in G. Herbert, on the scheme
<em>a b c<sub>5</sub> a b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub></em>, e.g. in <cite>Magdalena</cite> (p. 183):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">When blessed Marie wip’d  her Saviour’s feet,</div>
    <div class="line">(Whose precepts she had trampled on before)</div>
    <div class="line indent2">And wore them for a jewell on her head,</div>
    <div class="line">Shewing his steps should be the street,</div>
    <div class="line">Wherein she thenceforth evermore</div>
    <div class="line indent2">With pensive humblenesse would live and tread.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Other stanzas of his correspond to <em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub>
a<sub>3</sub></em>, &amp;c. In Moore we have a similar stanza: <em>a b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>2</sub> b a<sub>4</sub> c<sub>2</sub></em> which is
unequal-membered on account of the arrangement of rhyme (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>,
ii, § 344). An unusual form of stanza, which may also be classed under
this head, occurs in M. Arnold’s <cite>Human Life</cite> (p. 40), its formula being
<em>a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>4</sub> c a c b<sub>5</sub></em>.</p>

<p><a name="section262" id="section262"></a>
§ <b>262. A stanza of seven lines</b> is used in Dunbar’s poem <cite>The
Merchants of Edinborough</cite>, formed on the scheme <em>a a a b<sub>4</sub> B<sub>2</sub> a<sub>4</sub> B<sub>4</sub></em>; it
is very interesting on account of the duplication of the refrain-verses
(<em>B<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>B<sub>4</sub></em>). Apart from the first short refrain-verse the arrangement
of rhymes is the same as it is in the entwined tail-rhyme stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Quhy will ȝe, merchantis of renoun,</div>
    <div class="line">Lat Edinburgh, ȝour nobill toun,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_320" id="Pg_320" title="320"></a></p>

<p>The Modern English stanzas also mostly bear a greater or less
resemblance to the tail-rhyme stanza. This relationship is evident in a
stanza like <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>, used in Wordsworth, <cite>To the Daisy</cite>
(iii. 42):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Sweet flower! belike one day to have</div>
    <div class="line">A place upon thy Poets grave,</div>
    <div class="line indent4">I welcome thee once more:</div>
    <div class="line">But He, who was on land, at sea,</div>
    <div class="line">My Brother, too, in loving thee,</div>
    <div class="line">Although he loved more silently,</div>
    <div class="line indent4">Sleeps by his native shore.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A peculiar form of stanza occurring in M. Arnold’s <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">In Utrumque Paratus</cite>
(p. 45) with the formula <em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a c b c<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em> likewise belongs to this
group.</p>

<p>In other instances the longer part comes first on the model <em>a a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c
c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>, e.g. in Mrs. Hemans, <cite>The Sun</cite> (iv. 251).</p>

<p>Other stanzas correspond to <em>a a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c c c<sub>3</sub> B<sub>2</sub></em> and <em>a a a b c c<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>.</p>

<p>In other cases the equal-membered tail-rhyme stanza becomes
unequal-membered by adding to the second tail-verse another verse
rhyming with it, the formula being then <em>a a<sub>4</sub> B<sub>2</sub> a a<sub>4</sub> b B<sub>2</sub></em> (e.g. in
Longfellow, <cite>Victor Galbraith</cite>, p. 503) or <em>a a<sub>2</sub> b<sub>4</sub> c c<sub>2</sub> b<sub>4</sub> B<sub>3</sub></em> (in
Moore, <cite>Little man</cite>), or <em>a a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c ~ c ~ b b<sub>3</sub></em> (id., <cite>The Pilgrim</cite>).</p>

<p>Less closely allied to the tail-rhyme stanza are the forms which are
similar to it only in one half-strophe, e.g. those on the model <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub>
a b c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em> (Shelley, <cite>To Night</cite>, iii. 62), <em>a b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>2</sub> a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em> (id.
<cite>Lines</cite>, iii. 86), <em>a b b<sub>4</sub> r<sub>2</sub> a R<sub>4</sub> r2</em> (Tennyson, <cite>A Dirge</cite>, p. 16). For
other examples see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 347</p>

<p><a name="section263" id="section263"></a>
§ <b>263.</b> There are also some eight-, nine-, and ten-lined stanzas
similar to the tail-rhyme stanza. An <b>eight-lined stanza</b> of the form
<em>a<sub>4</sub> b a<sub>5</sub> c<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>4</sub> d d<sub>5</sub> c<sub>2</sub></em> occurs in Herbert, <cite>The Glance</cite> (p. 18), and
one of the form <em>a ~ a ~<sub>4</sub> B c ~ d c ~ d<sub>4</sub> B<sub>3</sub></em> in Moore’s <cite>Thee, thee,

<p>A stanza used by Wordsworth in <cite>Stray Pleasures</cite> (iv. 12) corresponds to
<em>a a<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c d d<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>.</p>

<p>Two stanzas used by M. Arnold correspond to the formulas <em>a a<sub>2</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c<sub>5</sub> d<sub>4</sub>

b<sub>5</sub> c c<sub>3</sub> d b d<sub>3</sub></em> in <cite>The World and the Quietist</cite> (p. 46).</p>

<p>A <b>stanza of nine lines</b> is found in Tennyson’s <cite>Lady of Shalott</cite> (p.
28); it is on the scheme <em>a a a a b c c c<sub>4</sub> b</em>; one of ten lines in his

C<sub>2</sub> d e e d<sub>5</sub> C<sub>3</sub></em> (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 349).</p>

<p>Other stanzas of this kind are related to the Septenary or the

§ <b>264. The bob-wheel stanzas.</b> This important class of bipartite
unequal-membered anisometrical stanzas was very much in vogue in the
Middle English period. They consist (see § <a href="#section222">222</a>) of a <em>frons</em> (longer
verses of four stresses, or Septenary and Alexandrine verses) and a
<em>cauda</em>, which is formed of shorter verses and is joined to the <em>frons</em>
by one or several ‘bob-verses’, belonging generally to the first part or
‘upsong’ (in German <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Aufgesang</cite>).</p>

<p>Sometimes it is doubtful whether these stanzas belong to the bipartite
or to the tripartite class, on account of the variety of rhymes in the
<em>frons</em>. But as they mostly consist of two quite unequal parts, they
certainly stand in a closer relationship to the bipartite stanzas.</p>

<p>A simple stanza of this kind on the scheme <em>A A<sub>7</sub> C<sub>1</sub> B<sub>7</sub></em> occurs in
William of Shoreham (printed in short lines on the model <em>A<sub>4</sub> B<sub>3</sub> C<sub>4</sub> B<sub>3</sub> d<sub>1</sub>
E<sub>4</sub> D<sub>3</sub></em>):</p>

<p>A six-lined stanza of Alexandrines and Septenaries on the
scheme <em>A A B B<sub>6</sub> c<sub>1</sub> C<sub>6</sub></em> is found in the poem <cite>On the evil Times
of Edward II</cite> (Wright’s <cite>Polit. Songs</cite>, p. 323). Another variety
originated by the breaking up of the longer verses into short
ones by inserted rhyme, as in the closing stanzas of a poem
by Minot (ed. Hall, p. 17) according to the formula
<em>A B A B A B A B<sub>3</sub> c<sub>1</sub> A C<sub>3</sub></em>; cf. the last stanza:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_322" id="Pg_322" title="322"></a></p>

<p>A similar form of stanza (<em>A B A B A B A B<sub>3</sub> c<sub>1</sub> B C<sub>3</sub></em>) is used
in the Romance of <cite>Sir Tristrem</cite>; that of the Scottish poem
<cite>Christ’s Kirk on the Green</cite>, however, is formed on the model
<em>A<sub>4</sub> B<sub>3</sub> A<sub>4</sub> B<sub>3</sub> A<sub>4</sub> B<sub>3</sub> b<sub>1</sub> B<sub>4</sub></em></p>

<p><a name="section265" id="section265"></a>
§ <b>265.</b> Still more common than stanzas of this kind composed
of even-beat verses, are those of four-stressed rhyming
verses with or without alliteration.</p>

<p>Under this head comes a poem in Wright’s <cite>Polit. Songs</cite>,
p. 69 (cf. § <a href="#section60">60</a>), on the scheme <em>A A A A<sub>4</sub> B<sub>3</sub> c<sub>1</sub> C<sub>3</sub> B<sub>4</sub></em>, or rather
<em>A A A A<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c<sub>1</sub> c<sub>2</sub> B<sub>4</sub></em>, the bob-verse being thus inserted in the
<em>cauda</em>. The common form comes out more clearly in another
poem, ibid., p. 212 (st. 1, quoted pp. 100&ndash;1), corresponding to
<em>A A A A<sub>4</sub> b<sub>1</sub> c c<sub>2</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em>, where <em>A A A A<sub>4</sub></em> are verses of four stresses,
<em>b a</em> one-stressed bob-verse or the half-verse of a long line, <em>c c<sub>2</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em>
half-verses of two stresses.

<cite>The Tournament of Tottenham</cite> (Ritson’s <cite>Anc. Songs</cite>, i. 85&ndash;9)
is written in a similar form of stanza with the formula
<em>A A A A<sub>4</sub> b c c c b<sub>2</sub></em>; the cauda consisting of five verses with two
stresses only.</p>

<p>This form of stanza is further developed by connecting the
halves of the long lines with each other by the insertion of
rhymes in the same way as in the stanzas of isometrical verses.
An example may be seen in Wright’s <cite>Polit. Songs</cite>, p. 153, the
scheme being <em>A A A A<sub>4</sub> b b<sub>1</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em> or <em>A A A A<sub>4</sub> b<sub>1</sub> b<sub>2</sub> b<sub>4</sub></em> (or, with
the longer lines broken up, <em>A B A B A B A B<sub>2</sub> c c<sub>1</sub> c<sub>2</sub></em>, or
<em>A B A B A B A B<sub>2</sub> c<sub>1</sub> c<sub>2</sub> C<sub>4</sub></em>, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>Similar stanzas, especially those on the model
<em>A A A A<sub>4</sub> b<sub>1</sub> c c c<sub>2</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em> (<em>A B A B A B A B<sub>2</sub> c<sub>1</sub> d d d<sub>2</sub> c<sub>2</sub></em>)
were much used in the mystery plays, as e.g. in the <cite>Towneley
Mysteries</cite> (pp. 20&ndash;34), even when in the dialogue the single lines
are divided between different speakers (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, i, pp. 390&ndash;1).</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_323" id="Pg_323" title="323"></a></p>

<p>The four-stressed long lines sometimes alternate with Alexandrine
and Septenary verses. In these plays stanzas of an eight-lined
<em>frons</em> consisting of long verses, rhyming crosswise and corresponding
to <em>A B A B A B A B<sub>4</sub> c<sub>1</sub> d d d<sub>2</sub> c<sub>2</sub></em> are also common:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="line indent8">As mali actoris.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Other stanzas, the first <em>cauda</em>-verse of which has four beats (on the
scheme <em>A B A B A B A B C<sub>4</sub> d d d c<sub>2</sub></em>), were also very much in vogue.
Stanzas of this kind occur in the poems <cite>Golagros and Gawane</cite>, <cite>The Buke
of the Howlat</cite>, <cite>Rauf Coilȝear</cite>, and <cite>The Awntyrs of Arthure at the
Terne Wathelyne</cite> (S. T. S. vol. 28; cf. § <a href="#section61">61</a>). An interesting variety of
the common form (with a five-lined <em>cauda</em>) we have in the poem <cite>Of
sayne John the Euangelist</cite> (E. E. T. S., 26, p. 87). The stanza consists
of an eight-lined <em>frons</em> of crossed rhymes and a <em>cauda</em> formed by a
six-lined tail-rhyme stanza<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> of two-beat verses, on the scheme <em>A B
A B A B A B<sub>4</sub> c c d c c d<sub>2</sub></em>.</p>

<p>As to the rhythmical structure of the half-verses used in the <em>cauda</em> of
the stanza cf. the explanations given in § <a href="#section64">64</a>.</p>

<p><a name="section266" id="section266"></a>
§ <b>266.</b> The bob-wheel stanzas<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> were preserved in the North in
Scottish poetry (e.g. Alex. Montgomerie) up to the Modern English
period.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> It is not unlikely that they found their way from this
source into Modern English poetry, where they are also met with, though
they have not attained any marked popularity.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_324" id="Pg_324" title="324"></a></p>

<p>It must, however, be kept in mind that the Modern English bob-wheel
stanzas are not a direct imitation of the Middle English. Sometimes they
were influenced probably by the odes, as there is a marked likeness
between these two forms, e.g. in two stanzas of Donne (<cite>Poets</cite>, iv. 24
and 39) on the schemes <em>A B A B C C<sub>4</sub> d d<sub>1</sub> D<sub>4</sub></em> and <em>A<sub>2</sub> A<sub>5</sub> B<sub>4</sub> C C<sub>5</sub> B<sub>4</sub> d<sub>1</sub> D
E E<sub>5</sub></em>; or in a stanza of Ben Jonson in an ode to Wm. Sidney (<cite>Poets</cite>,
iv. 558) on the model <em>A<sub>5</sub> B<sub>4</sub> c c<sub>1</sub> B<sub>3</sub> a d d e<sub>2</sub> E<sub>5</sub></em>, and in another in
<cite>The Dream</cite> (iv. 566), <em>A A<sub>4</sub> B<sub>3</sub> C C<sub>4</sub> A<sub>5</sub> A<sub>4</sub> B<sub>3</sub> b<sub>1</sub> D D<sub>3</sub> E E<sub>4</sub> B<sub>5</sub></em>.</p>

<p>In this and other cases they consist of even-measured, seldom of
four-stressed verses, as e.g. in Suckling, who seems to have been very
fond of these forms of stanza; cf. the following stanza on the model <em>A
A<sub>4</sub> B<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>1</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em> (<cite>Poets</cite>, iii. 736):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">That none beguiled be by time’s quick flowing,</div>
    <div class="line">Lovers have in their hearts a clock still going;</div>
    <div class="line indent2">For though time be nimble, his motions</div>
    <div class="line indent8">Are quicker</div>
    <div class="line indent8">And thicker</div>
    <div class="line indent4">Where love hath its notions.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Other bob-wheel stanzas in Suckling show the schemes <em>A A<sub>4</sub> a<sub>2</sub> b b<sub>3</sub></em> (ib.
iii. 740), <em>A A A<sub>4</sub> B B<sub>5</sub> c<sub>2</sub> c<sub>1</sub> C D<sub>4</sub> d<sub>2</sub></em> (ib. iii. 729), <em>A A B B<sub>4</sub> c<sub>1</sub> c d<sub>2</sub>
D<sub>5</sub></em> (ib. 739).</p>

<p>More similar to the older forms is a stanza of a song in Dryden formed
after <em>A A B B C<sub>4</sub> d d e e<sub>2</sub> e<sub>3</sub></em> (p. 339).</p>

<p>In Modern poetry such stanzas are used especially by Burns, Scott, and
sometimes by Moore. So we have in Burns a fine simple stanza on the
model <em>A<sub>4</sub> B<sub>3</sub> A<sub>4</sub> B<sub>3</sub> c<sub>1</sub> B<sub>3</sub></em>, similar to the Shoreham stanza (cf. § <a href="#section264">264</a>):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">It was a’ for our rightfu’ king</div>

    <div class="line indent2">We e’er saw Irish land,</div>
    <div class="line indent16">My dear;</div>
    <div class="line indent2">We e’er saw Irish land.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Similar stanzas occur in Moore on the formula <em>A<sub>4</sub> B<sub>3</sub> A<sub>4</sub> B<sub>3</sub> a<sub>1</sub> B<sub>3</sub></em> in
<cite>Then fare thee well</cite>, on <em>A<sub>4</sub> B ~<sub>3</sub> A<sub>4</sub> B ~<sub>3</sub> c<sub>1</sub> B ~<sub>3</sub></em> in <cite>Dear Fanny</cite>.
Other stanzas by the same poet have a somewhat longer <em>cauda</em>, as <em>A<sub>4</sub> B
~<sub>3</sub> A<sub>4</sub> B ~<sub>3</sub> c ~ c ~ d ~ d ~<sub>1</sub> A<sub>4</sub> C ~<sub>3</sub></em> or <em>A B ~ A B ~ C ~ C ~<sub>4</sub> d d<sub>2</sub> E F ~
E F ~<sub>4</sub></em>.</p>

<p>A stanza used by Sir Walter Scott in <cite>To the Sub-Prior</cite> (p. 461) is
formed on the model <em>A A B B<sub>4</sub> c<sub>1</sub> c<sub>2</sub> C<sub>4</sub></em>, the <em>frons</em> consisting of
four-stressed verses:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_325" id="Pg_325" title="325"></a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

    <div class="line">With your mule so fair, and your mantle so wide;</div>

    <div class="line indent10">The volume black!</div>
    <div class="line">I have a warrant to carry it back.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Most of these stanzas admit of being looked upon as tripartite on
account of the bipartite structure of the <em>frons</em>.</p>

<p>Other stanzas may be viewed as consisting of three unequal parts (if not
regarded as bipartite); such, for instance, is the stanza on the scheme
(<em>a</em>) ~ <em>A</em> ~ (<em>b</em>) <em>~ B ~<sub>4</sub> c<sub>1</sub></em> (<em>d</em>) <em>D<sub>4</sub> b ~<sub>1</sub> e e e c c<sub>2</sub> C<sub>4</sub></em> occurring
in Shelley’s <cite>Autumn, A Dirge</cite> (iii. 65), where the symbols (<em>a</em>)and
(<em>b</em>) denote middle rhymes.</p>

<p>Stanzas of this kind are met with also in modern poetry, as e.g. in
Thackeray, Mrs. Browning, and Rossetti (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii,
§§ 353, 354).</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="subtitle">TRIPARTITE STANZAS</span></h3>


<h4>I. <em>Isometrical stanzas.</em></h4>

<p><a name="section267" id="section267"></a>
§ <b>267.</b> In the anisometrical stanzas (which might, as being the older
species, have been treated of first) the distinction between the first
and the last part of the stanza (<em>frons</em> and <em>cauda</em>) is marked as a
rule by a difference of metre in them; in isometrical stanzas, on the
other hand, the distinction between the two parts depends solely on the
arrangement of the rhyme. For this reason certain <b>six-lined stanzas</b>
consisting of two equal parts and a third of the same structure (the
formula being <em>a a b b c c<sub>4</sub></em> or the like), which now and then occur in
the <cite>Surtees Psalter</cite> (e.g. Ps. xliv, st. 5), cannot strictly be called
tripartite.</p>

<p>Stanzas like these are, however, not unfrequent in Modern English
poetry, as e.g. in a song of Carew’s (<cite>Poets</cite>, iii. 292):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Cease, thou afflicted soul, to mourn,</div>
    <div class="line">Whose love and faith are paid with scorn;</div>
    <div class="line">For I am starv’d  that feel the blisses</div>
    <div class="line">Of dear embraces, smiles and kisses,</div>
    <div class="line">From my soul’s idol, yet complain</div>
    <div class="line">Of equal love more than disdain.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>For an account of many other stanzas of the same or similar structure
(consisting of trochaic four-foot lines, iambic-anapaestic lines of four
stresses, or lines of five, six, and seven measures), see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii,
§§ 355, 356.</p>

<p>It is only rarely that we find stanzas formed on the scheme <em>a a a a b
b</em> (e.g. in the <cite>Surtees Psalter</cite>, xlix. 21; in Ben Jonson, <cite>Poets</cite>,
iv. 574); or on the formula <em>a a b b a b<sub>4</sub></em>, as in Swinburne, <cite>Poems</cite>, i.
248.</p>

<p>One form, analogous to the stanza first mentioned in this section and
used pretty often in Modern English, has crossed rhymes <em>a b a b a b</em>.
It occurs with four-foot verses in Byron, <cite>She walks in Beauty</cite>:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_327" id="Pg_327" title="327"></a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">She walks in beauty, like the night</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Of cloudless climes and starry skies:</div>
    <div class="line">And all that’s best of dark and bright</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Meet in her aspect and her eyes;</div>
    <div class="line">Thus mellow’d  to that tender light</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Which Heaven to gaudy day denies.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The same stanza of trochaic or iambic-anapaestic metres of three or five
measures is also frequently met with (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 358).</p>

<p>The tripartite character of a strophe appears somewhat more distinctly
in stanzas formed on the scheme <em>a b a b b b</em>, or <em>a b a b b x</em> (cf.
<cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §359).</p>

<p>The only stanzas, however, that are in the strictest sense to be
regarded as tripartite are those in which the first and the last part
are clearly distinguished by the arrangement of rhymes, as e.g. in the
type <em>a b a b c c</em>. This stanza is very popular in Modern English poetry; in
the Middle English period, however, we find it very rarely used, as e.g.
in the <cite>Coventry Mysteries</cite>, p. 315.</p>

<p>In Modern English it occurs e.g. in Surrey, <cite>A Prayse of his Love</cite> (p.
31):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Give place, ye lovers, here before</div>
    <div class="line indent2">That spend your boasts and brags in vain;</div>
    <div class="line">My Lady’s beauty passeth more</div>
    <div class="line indent2">The best of yours, I dare well sayen,</div>
    <div class="line">Than doth the sun the candle light,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Or brightest day the darkest night.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This form of stanza is used with lines of the same metres by many other
poets, e.g. by M. Arnold, pp. 195, 197, 256, 318. Similar stanzas of
four-foot trochaic (cf. p. 285), or of four-stressed verses, and
especially of five-foot verses, are very popular. They are found e.g. in
Shakespeare’s <cite>Venus and Adonis</cite>, M. Arnold’s <cite>Mycerinus</cite> (first part,
p. 8), &amp;c. (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 360, 361).</p>

<p>Similar stanzas, however, in which the <em>frons</em> precedes the <em>versus</em>,
according to the formula <em>a a b c b c</em> (cf. <a href="#Pg_285">p. 285</a>), do not occur
frequently; a rare form, also, is that in which the <em>cauda</em> is placed
between the two <em>pedes</em> (cf. <a href="#Pg_285">p. 285</a> and <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §362)</p>

<p><a name="section268" id="section268"></a>
§ <b>268.</b> Still more popular than the six-lined stanzas, both in the
Middle and in the Modern English periods, are those <b>of seven lines</b>,
which are modelled on Old French lyric poetry, the<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_328" id="Pg_328" title="328"></a> prevailing type
being that of an Old French ballade-stanza, viz. <em>a b a b b c c</em>. But it
is not before the middle of the fifteenth century that we meet with an
example of this stanza consisting of four-foot verses, viz. in Lydgate’s
Minor Poems (<cite>Percy Society</cite>, 1840), p. 129; a specimen of four-stressed
verses occurs in the <cite>Chester Plays</cite>, pp. 1&ndash;7 and pp. 156&ndash;8. We may,
however, take it for granted that this form of stanza was known long
before that time, since four-foot verses were used much earlier than
those of five feet, and a six-lined stanza of five-foot verses occurs
(for the first time, so far as we know) as early as in Chaucer’s
<cite>Compleynte of the Dethe of Pite</cite>, and subsequently in many other of his
poems (e.g. <cite>Troylus and Cryseyde</cite>, <cite>The Assembly of Fowles</cite>, <cite>The
Clerkes Tale</cite>) and in numerous other poems of his successors, e.g. in
<cite>The Kingis Quair</cite> by King James I of Scotland. It has been sometimes
maintained that this stanza was called <em>rhyme royal</em> stanza because that
royal poet wrote his well-known poem in it; this, however, is not so.
Guest long ago pointed out (ii. 359) that this name is to be derived
from the French term <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chant-royal</em>, applied to certain poems of similar
stanzas which were composed in praise of God or the Virgin, and used to
be recited in the poetical contests at Rouen on the occasion of the
election of a ‘king’. Chaucer’s verses to Adam Scrivener are of this
form and may be quoted as a specimen here (after Skeat’s text, p. 118):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Adam scriveyn, if euer it thee bifalle</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Boece or Troylus to writen newe,</div>
    <div class="line">Under thy lokkes thou most haue the scalle,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">But after my making thou write trewe.</div>
    <div class="line indent2">So oft a day I mot thy werk renewe</div>
    <div class="line">Hit to corrects and eek to rubbe and scrape,</div>
    <div class="line">And al is through thy negligence and rape.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In Modern English this beautiful stanza was very popular up to the end
of the sixteenth century; Shakespeare, e.g., wrote his <cite>Lucrece</cite> in it;
afterwards, however, it unfortunately fell almost entirely out of use
(cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 364).</p>

<p>The same form of stanza, composed of two-, three-, or four-foot verses
also occurs almost exclusively in the Early Modern English period (cf.
ib., § 363).</p>

<p>Some varieties of this stanza, mostly formed of three-, four-, and
five-foot verses, correspond to the schemes <em>a b a b c c b<sub>4</sub></em> (e.g. in
Akenside, Book I, Ode iii), <em>a b a b c b c<sub>5</sub></em> (Spenser, <cite>Daphnaïda</cite>, p.
542), <em>a b a b c b c<sub>2</sub></em> (R. Browning, vi. 41). Other<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_329" id="Pg_329" title="329"></a> stanzas of seven
lines are <em>a b a b c c a<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a a b b c c a<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a a b b a c c<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a b a b
C d C<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a a b b c c c<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a b a b c c c<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a b a b c c c<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a b a c
c d d<sub>5</sub></em> (for specimens see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 365, 366).</p>

<p><a name="section269" id="section269"></a>
§ <b>269. Eight-lined isometrical stanzas</b> are also frequently used in the
Middle and Modern English period, though not so often as those of six
and seven lines.</p>

<p>The scheme <em>a b a b b a b a</em>, formed from the simple equal-membered
stanza of eight lines <em>a b a b a b a b</em>, it would seem, by inversion of
the last two couplets, is rare in Middle English. We find it in the
<cite>Digby Plays</cite>, consisting of four-foot verses. In Modern English, too,
it is not very common; we have an example in Wyatt, e.g. pp. 118, 135,
and another in the same poet, formed of five-foot verses (<em>a b a b b a b
a<sub>5</sub></em>), p. 135.</p>

<p>Much more in favour in the Middle as well as in the Modern English
period is the typical form of the eight-lined stanza, corresponding to
the scheme <em>a b a b b c b c</em>. It is formed from the preceding stanza by
the introduction of a new rhyme in the sixth and eighth verses, and it
had its model likewise in a popular ballade-stanza of Old French lyrical
poetry.</p>

<p>In Middle English poetry this stanza is very common, consisting either
of four-stressed verses (e.g. in <cite>The Lyfe of Joseph of Arimathia</cite>, E.
E. T. S., vol. 44, and <cite>On the death of the Duke of Suffolk</cite>, Wright’s
<cite>Polit. Poems</cite>, ii. 232) or of four-foot or five-foot verses. As an
example of the form consisting of four-foot verses we may quote a stanza
from Wright’s <cite>Polit. Songs</cite>, p. 246:</p>

<p>Many other examples occur in later poetry, e.g. in Minot, Lydgate,
Dunbar, Lyndesay, in Wyatt, p. 119, Burns, p. 59, Walter Scott, p. 160,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Similar stanzas of two-stressed and three-foot verses are only of rare
occurrence; we find them e.g. in Percy’s <cite>Rel.</cite> <span class="fakesc">II.</span> ii. 3; Wyatt, p.
41.</p>

<p>The same stanza, consisting of five-foot verses, was used by<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_330" id="Pg_330" title="330"></a> Chaucer in
his <em>A B C</em>, the first stanza of which may be quoted here:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="line">Venquysshed m’ hath my cruel adversaire.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Chaucer uses the same stanza in some other minor poems, and also in <cite>The
Monkes Tale</cite>; besides this we find it often in Lydgate, Dunbar, Kennedy;
more rarely in Modern English poetry; e.g. in Spenser’s <cite>Shepheard’s
Cal., Ecl. XI</cite>, S. Daniel’s <cite>Cleopatra</cite>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Now and then some other eight-lined stanzas occur, e.g. one with the
formula <em>a b a b b c c b</em>in Chaucer’s <cite>Complaynt of Venus</cite>, and in the
<cite>Flyting</cite> by Dunbar and Kennedy. The scheme <em>a a b b c d c d</em> is used in
a love-song (<cite>Rel. Ant.</cite> i. 70&ndash;4). In the Modern English period we have
stanzas on the schemes <em>a ~ b a ~ b c c d ~ d ~<sub>4</sub></em> (in Sidney, <cite>Psalm
XLIII</cite>), <em>a b a b c c c b<sub>4</sub></em> (Scott, <cite>Helvellyn</cite>, p. 472), <em>a ~ b a ~ b c
~ c ~ d ~ d ~<sub>2</sub></em> (Moore); cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 369&ndash;71.</p>

<p>There are also eight-lined stanzas formed by combination with tail-rhyme
stanzas, as <em>a a b a a b c c<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a a b c c d d b<sub>4</sub></em>, but they are not
frequent; a stanza corresponding to the formula <em>a a b a a b c c<sub>4</sub></em> we
have in Spenser, <cite>Epigram III</cite> (p. 586); and the variety <em>a a b c c d d
b<sub>4</sub></em> (the <em>cauda</em> being enclosed by the <em>pedes</em>) occurs in Moore.</p>

<p>The same peculiarity we find in stanzas formed on the scheme <em>A A b c b
c A A<sub>4</sub></em> (Moore), or <em>a a b c b c d d<sub>4</sub></em> (Wordsworth, ii. 267); cf.
<cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 372, 373</p>

<p><a name="section270" id="section270"></a>
§ <b>270.</b> Stanzas of a still larger compass are of rare occurrence in
Middle English poetry. <b>A nine-lined stanza</b> corresponding to the
formula <em>a a b a a b b c c<sub>5</sub></em> we have in Chaucer’s <cite>Complaynt of Mars</cite>;
it seems to be formed from the <cite>rhyme royal</cite> stanza, by adding one verse
to each <em>pes</em>; but it might also be looked upon as a combination with
the tail-rhyme stanza. Another stanza of this kind, with the formula <em>a
a b a a b b a b<sub>5</sub></em>, is used in Chaucer’s <cite>Complaynt of Faire Anelyda</cite> and
in Dunbar’s <cite>Goldin Targe</cite>.</p>

<p>A similar stanza, corresponding to the formula <em>a a b c c b d b d<sub>4</sub></em>,<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_331" id="Pg_331" title="331"></a>
occurs in Modern English poetry in John Scott, <cite>Ode XII</cite>. Other stanzas
used in the Modern English period are formed with parallel rhymes, as e.
g. on the scheme <em>a a a b b b c c c<sub>4</sub></em> (Walter Scott, <cite>Lady of the Lake</cite>,
p. 187); forms with crossed rhymes throughout or partly are also used,
as e.g. by Wyatt, p. 121, according to the formula <em>a b a b c c c d
d<sub>5</sub></em>:</p>

<p><a name="section271" id="section271"></a>
§ <b>271.</b> A Middle English <b>stanza of ten lines</b>, similar to those of
nine lines, is used by Chaucer in the <cite>Envoy</cite> to his <cite>Complaynt of Mars
and Venus</cite> (<em>a a b a a b b a a b<sub>5</sub></em>); another on the model <em>a b a b b c c
b b b<sub>4</sub></em>is found in a poem <cite>Long Life</cite> (E. E. T. S., 49, p. 156, quoted
in <cite>Metrik</cite>, i. p. 421).</p>

<p>Some of the Modern English stanzas again are formed by combination with
different varieties of the tail-rhyme stanza, as e.g. one according to
the formula <em>a a b ~ c c b ~ d d e e<sub>4</sub></em> in Prior, <cite>The Parallel</cite> (Poets,
vii. 507):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>

<p>A stanza of trochaic verses corresponding to a similar scheme, viz. <em>a a
b c c b d d d b<sub>4</sub></em>, is used by Tennyson in <cite>The Window</cite> (p. 284).</p>

<p>Sometimes the scheme is <em>a b a b c c d e e d<sub>4</sub></em> (where there are two
<em>pedes</em> forming a <em>frons</em>, and a tail-rhyme stanza equivalent to two
<em>versus</em>), as in Akenside, Book I, Ode II (<cite>Poets</cite>, ix. 773).</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_332" id="Pg_332" title="332"></a></p>


<p>Some stanzas, on the other hand, have a parallel arrangement of rhymes,
<em>a a b b c c d d e E</em> (<em>e E</em> being the <em>cauda</em>) as in Walter Scott,
<cite>Soldier, Wake</cite> (p. 465); or more frequently crossed rhymes, <em>a b a b c
d c d e e<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a b a b c d c d e e<sub>4</sub></em>, the first eight verses forming the
upsong (<em>pedes</em>); or with a four-lined upsong <em>a a b b c d c d e e<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a
a b b c d d e d e<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a b a b b c c d c D<sub>5</sub></em>. The last-mentioned form has
been used several times by Swinburne, e.g. <cite>Poems</cite>, ii, pp. 126, 215,
219, &amp;c., in his ballads. For specimens see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 379&ndash;81.</p>

<p><a name="section272" id="section272"></a>
§ <b>272. Stanzas of eleven lines</b> are very scarce in Middle English
poetry, if used there at all, and even in Modern English very few
examples occur. A stanza of Swinburne’s may be mentioned here, imitated
from an Old French ballade- (or rather <em>chant-royal</em>) stanza,
corresponding to the formula <em>a b a b c c d d e d E<sub>5</sub></em> and used in a
<cite>Ballad against the Enemies of France</cite> (Poems, ii. 212). Cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>,
ii, §382.</p>

<p><b>Twelve-lined stanzas</b> are much more frequently used, even in Middle
English poetry; one of four-foot verses according to the scheme <em>a b a b
a b a b b c b C</em> (the stanzas being connected into groups by
<em>concatenatio</em>) occurs in the fine fourteenth-century poem, <cite>The Pearl</cite>.
Another of four-stressed verses corresponding to the formula <em>a b a b a
b a b c d c d</em> we have in Wright’s <cite>Polit. Songs</cite>, p. 149; one of
four-foot verses together with other forms of stanzas (<em>a b a b a b a b
a b a b</em>, <em>a b a b c d c d e f e f</em>) we have in the poem on the
<cite>Childhood of Christ</cite> (ed. Horstmann, Heilbronn, 1878).</p>

<p>But it is chiefly in Modern English poetry that stanzas of twelve lines
are very common, especially stanzas consisting of three equal parts,
with crossed rhymes. In some of these there is no difference at all in
the structure of the three parts, as e.g. in a stanza by Prior
(<cite>Poets</cite>, vii. 402) on the model <em>a b a b c d c d e f e f<sub>4</sub></em>; while in
others the refrain (consisting of the four last verses) forms the
<em>cauda</em>, as e.g. in Moore’s <cite>Song on the Birthday of Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Of all my happiest hours of joy,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">And even I have had my measure,</div>
    <div class="line">When hearts were full, and ev’ry eye</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Hath kindled with the light of pleasure,</div>
    <div class="line">An hour like this I ne’er was given,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">So full of friendship’s purest blisses;</div>
    <div class="line">Young Love himself looks down from heaven,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">To smile on such a day as this is.<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_333" id="Pg_333" title="333"></a></div>
    <div class="line">Then come, my friends, this hour improve,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Let’s feel as if we ne’er could sever;</div>
    <div class="line">And may the birth of her we love</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Be thus with joy remember’d  ever!</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now and then certain modifications of this form of stanza are met with,
especially stanzas the four-lined refrain of which forms not only the
end, but also the beginning, of the stanza (but as a rule only in the
first stanza, the others having the refrain only at the end); e.g. <em>A B
A B c d c d A B A B<sub>3</sub></em> (st. 1), <em>d e d e f g f g A B A B<sub>3</sub></em>. (st. 2), <em>h i
h i k l k l A B A B<sub>3</sub></em> (st. 3), in Moore, <cite>Drink to her</cite>.</p>

<p>In other poems Moore uses this type of stanza with lines of four
stresses, as in <cite>Drink of this cup</cite>, and with lines of two stresses, as
in <cite>When the Balaika</cite>. For some rarely occurring stanzas of this kind
see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 385, 386.</p>

<p>A <b>stanza of thirteen lines</b> corresponding to the formula <em>a b a b b c b
c d e e e d<sub>4</sub></em> occurs in the Middle English poem <cite>The Eleven Pains of
Hell</cite> (E. E. T. S., 49, p. 210). Another one on the scheme <em>a ~ a ~ B c
~ c ~ B d ~ d ~ d ~ b e ~ e ~ B<sub>3</sub></em> we have in Moore, <cite>Go where glory
waits thee</cite>.</p>

<p>As to stanzas of fifteen and eighteen lines see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 387.</p>


<h4>II.  <em>Anisometrical stanzas.</em></h4>

<p><a name="section273" id="section273"></a>
§ <b>273.</b> As mentioned before (§ 267) the anisometrical stanzas of the
tripartite class, being older, might have been dealt with before the
isometrical stanzas. This chronological order of treatment, however,
would have been somewhat inconvenient in practice, as it would have
involved the necessity of discussing many of the more complicated
stanzas before the shorter and simpler ones, most of which do not occur
in Middle English, but in Modern poetry only. Moreover, the absence of
certain simple and short forms of stanza constructed in accordance with
the principles which were generally adopted in the Middle English period
is a purely accidental circumstance, which is liable at any moment to be
altered by the discovery of new texts.</p>

<p>In the following paragraphs, therefore, the stanzas belonging to this
chapter are discussed according to their arrangement of rhymes and to
the length of the lines of which they are composed.</p>

<p>We begin with certain <b>stanzas of six lines</b>, the first part (the<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_334" id="Pg_334" title="334"></a>
<em>frons</em> or ‘upsong’) of which is isometrical, the arrangement of rhymes
being parallel.</p>

<p>A pretty stanza with the scheme <em>a a b b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>4</sub></em> presents itself in the
song <cite>The Fairy Queen</cite> (Percy’s <cite>Rel</cite>. <span class="fakesc">III.</span> ii. 26):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line indent2">Come, follow, follow me,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">You, fairy elves that be:</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Which circle on the greene,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Come, follow Mab, your queene,</div>
    <div class="line">Hand in hand let’s dance around,</div>
    <div class="line">For this place is fairye ground.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>For similar stanzas conforming to the schemes <em>a a b b<sub>4</sub> c c<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a a b b
c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a a b b c ~ c ~<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a a b b<sub>6</sub> c ~ c ~<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a a b b c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>3</sub></em> (in
Moore, <cite>The Wandering Bard</cite>), &amp;c., see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 389.</p>

<p>Another group is represented by stanzas of six rhyming couplets of
unequal length, as <em>a<sub>5</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>4</sub></em> (Sidney, <cite>Psalm XXXIX</cite>), <em>a<sub>6</sub> a<sub>3</sub>
b<sub>6</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>6</sub> c<sub>3</sub></em> (id. <cite>Psalm II</cite>); or <em>a<sub>5</sub> a<sub>2</sub> b<sub>5</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c c<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>4</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c
c<sub>4</sub></em>, frequently used by Herbert and Cowley, or <em>a<sub>5</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a a
b<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>4</sub></em> (in Moore, <cite>St. Senanus and the Lady</cite>), the two <em>pedes</em>
enclosing the <em>cauda</em> (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 390&ndash;2).</p>

<p>Similar stanzas with crossed rhymes occur pretty often, especially
stanzas of three Septenary verses broken up by inserted rhyme, according
to the formula <em>a<sub>4</sub> b ~<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b ~<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b ~<sub>3</sub></em>, as in Moore, <cite>The Gazelle</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Dost thou not hear the silver bell,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Thro’ yonder lime-trees ringing?</div>
    <div class="line">’Tis my lady’s light gazelle,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">To me her love-thoughts bringing,&mdash;</div>
    <div class="line">All the while that silver bell</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Around his dark neck ringing.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>For other specimens see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 393</p>

<p><a name="section274" id="section274"></a>
§ <b>274.</b> More popular are stanzas of a more distinctly tripartite
character, formed on the scheme <em>a b a b c c</em> (which occurs also in the
isometrical group). These stanzas are used in many various forms, as e.
g. one in Cowper, <cite>Olney Hymns</cite> (p. 25), like <em>a b a b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>4</sub></em>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">By whom was David taught</div>
    <div class="line indent2">To aim the deadly blow,</div>
    <div class="line">When he Goliath fought,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">And laid the Gittite low?</div>
    <div class="line">Nor sword nor spear the stripling took,</div>
    <div class="line">But chose a pebble from the brook.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_335" id="Pg_335" title="335"></a></p>

<p>Numerous other examples are quoted in <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 394, together with
similar stanzas formed according to the schemes <em>a b ~ a b ~<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a
b a b<sub>3</sub> C C<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a ~ b a ~ b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a b a b<sub>4</sub> c c<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a ~ b a ~ b<sub>4</sub> c c<sub>6</sub></em>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The reverse order with regard to the length of the verses in the <em>pedes</em>
and the <em>cauda</em> is also not uncommon, as e.g. in stanzas on the schemes
<em>a b a b c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a b a b c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a b a b<sub>5</sub> c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub></em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Stanzas of this kind are met with chiefly in the earlier Modern English
poets, e.g. in Cowley and Herbert. Shorter lines also are used, e.g.
in stanzas corresponding to the formulas <em>a b a b<sub>4</sub> c c<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a b a b<sub>4</sub> c
c<sub>2</sub></em>; stanzas like these also occur later, e.g. in Moore. In Cowley, now
and then, a stanza is found with a preceding <em>frons</em> (on the scheme <em>a
a<sub>5</sub> b c b c<sub>4</sub></em>). In Moore we find yet another variety (in <cite>Poor broken
flower</cite>), the <em>cauda</em> of which is enclosed by the <em>pedes</em> (according to
the formula <em>a ~ b<sub>5</sub> c c<sub>3</sub> a ~ b<sub>5</sub></em>).</p>

<p>Another group of stanzas is to be mentioned here, the verses of which
are of different length in the first part, admitting of many various
combinations. Especially stanzas of Septenary rhythm in the first part
are very popular, as e.g. in Cowper’s fine poem <cite>The Castaway</cite> (p.
400), on the scheme <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>4</sub></em>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Obscurest night involved the sky,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">The Atlantic billows roared,</div>
    <div class="line">When such a destined wretch as I,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Washed headlong from on board,</div>
    <div class="line">Of friends, of hope, of all bereft,</div>
    <div class="line">His floating home for ever left.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>There are many varieties of this form of stanza, as e.g. <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c
c<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c c<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>5</sub>
b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub> c c<sub>5</sub></em>; <em>a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>4</sub> c c<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>2</sub> b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>2</sub> b<sub>4</sub> c c<sub>5</sub></em>. All these
different schemes were chiefly used by the earlier Modern English poets,
as Browne, Carew, Cowley, Waller, and Herbert. (See <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §
397).</p>

<p>There are some other stanzas of allied structure which may be regarded
as extensions of the Poulter’s Measure by the addition of a second
Alexandrine or Septenary verse, their formulas being <em>a b c b<sub>3</sub> d<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub></em> or
<em>a b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> d<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub></em>. For examples see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 398.</p>

<p><a name="section275" id="section275"></a>
§ <b>275. Stanzas of seven lines</b> are very common, and have many diverse
forms. In the first place may be mentioned those which have parallel
arrangement of rhymes, and in which the <em>frons</em> is isometrical. Some of
these forms, used chiefly by the<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_336" id="Pg_336" title="336"></a> earlier poets, as Cowley, Sheffield,
and others, have the scheme <em>a a b b c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>2</sub> c<sub>5</sub></em> or <em>a a b b c<sub>4</sub> c a<sub>5</sub></em>.
Another variety, with alternate four-and two-foot iambic-anapaestic
lines according to the formula <em>a a b b<sub>4</sub> r r<sub>2</sub> R<sub>4</sub></em>, occurs in Moore,
<cite>The Legend of Puck the Fairy</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Would’st know what tricks, by the pale moonlight,</div>
    <div class="line">Are play’d  by me, the merry little Sprite,</div>
    <div class="line">Who wing through air from the camp to the court,</div>
    <div class="line">From king to clown, and of all make sport;</div>
    <div class="line indent8">Singing, I am the Sprite</div>
    <div class="line indent8">Of the merry midnight,</div>
    <div class="line">Who laugh at weak mortals, and love the moonlight.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Stanzas with an anisometrical first part, e.g. on the model <em>a<sub>4</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub>
b<sub>5</sub> c c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub></em>in Donne, <cite>Love’s Exchange</cite> (Poets, iv. 30), are of rare
occurrence.</p>

<p>Numerous stanzas of this kind have in part crossed rhymes; we find, e.
g., stanzas with the same order of rhymes as in the <em>rhyme royal, </em>on
the model <em>a b a b b c<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub></em> as in S. Daniel, <cite>A Description of Beauty</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">O Beauty (beams, nay, flame</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Of that great lamp of light),</div>

    <div class="line indent2">But presently makes night!</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Like winter’s shortliv’d  bright,</div>
    <div class="line">Or summer’s sudden gleams;</div>
    <div class="line">How much more dear, so much less lasting beams.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Similar stanzas have the schemes <em>a b a b b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a b a b c b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>2</sub></em>,
<em>a b a b c c<sub>4</sub> R<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>a b a b c c<sub>4</sub> C<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a b a b c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a b a b<sub>4</sub> c c<sub>2</sub>
a<sub>4</sub></em>, &amp;c. For examples see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 401&ndash;3.</p>

<p>In many stanzas the first and the last part (<em>frons</em> and <em>cauda</em>) are
anisometrical. Thus Donne, Cowley, and Congreve furnish many examples of
the formulas <em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub> c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a ~<sub>4</sub> b<sub>6</sub> a ~<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c c<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> a<sub>4</sub>
b<sub>5</sub> c c<sub>2</sub> b<sub>4</sub></em>, and later poets make frequent use of similar stanzas
composed of shorter lines after the model of the following by Congreve,
<cite>Poets</cite>, vii. 546 (<em>a<sub>4</sub> b ~<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b ~<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>4</sub> b ~<sub>3</sub></em>):</p>

 § <b>276. Eight-lined stanzas</b> of various kinds are also very popular.
They rarely occur, however, with an isometrical <em>frons</em>, composed of
rhyming couplets (<em>a a b b c c d<sub>5</sub> d<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a ~ a ~ b ~ b ~<sub>4</sub> C ~ C ~<sub>2</sub> d ~ d
~<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a a b b c c d<sub>4</sub> d<sub>5</sub></em>; cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 408, 410); or with
enclosing rhymes in the <em>cauda</em> (<em>a a b b c d d<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a a b b<sub>4</sub> c d<sub>4</sub> d<sub>2</sub>
c<sub>4</sub></em>, ib. § 409); or of an anisometrical structure with parallel rhymes
in both parts (ib. § 411).</p>

<p>The usual forms show crossed rhymes; either throughout the whole stanza
(in which case the first part is isometrical), or in the first part
only. The first form is represented by the following elegant stanza (<em>a
b a b<sub>5</sub> c<sub>4</sub> d ~<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> d ~<sub>3</sub></em>) in the second of Drayton’s <cite>Eclogues</cite> (Poets,
iii. 590):</p>

415.</p>

<p>Sometimes stanzas occur, the isometrical part of which forms the
<em>cauda</em>, as on the scheme <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c d d<sub>4</sub></em> in Moore, <cite>Sovereign

<p><a name="section277" id="section277"></a>
§ <b>277.</b> Very frequently stanzas occur which are of an entirely
anisometrical structure in both parts. To this group belong the first
tripartite anisometrical stanzas of the Middle English period, contained
in Wright’s <cite>Spec. of Lyr. Poetry</cite>, p. 111 (two songs). Their stanzaic
form (<em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> b b<sub>5</sub> c<sub>7</sub> c<sub>5</sub></em>) is also of great importance, on account
of the fact that the first five-foot verses as yet known in English
poetry occur in the <em>cauda</em> of these stanzas. The first strophe may
serve as an example:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line indent4">Lutel wot hit anymon,</div>
    <div class="line indent6">Hou loue hym haueþ ybounde,</div>
    <div class="line indent4">Þat for us oþe rode ron,</div>
    <div class="line indent6">Ant bohte vs wiþ is wounde,</div>
    <div class="line indent6">Þe loue of hym vs haueþ ymaked sounde,</div>
    <div class="line indent6">Ant yeast þe grimly gost to grounde.</div>
    <div class="line">Euer ant oo, nyht ant day, hi haueþ vs in is þohte,</div>
    <div class="line">He nul nout leose þat he so deore bohte.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This stanza is also interesting on account of its regular use of
masculine rhymes in the first and in the third line, and of feminine
rhymes in the others. The structure of the five-measured verses employed
in this stanza has been referred to before (§ <a href="#section153">153</a>).</p>

<p>Very often both main parts, the <em>upsong</em> and the <em>downsong</em>, have
crossed rhymes in Modern English, e.g. in a form of stanza with the
scheme <em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c d<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub> d<sub>2</sub></em> in Southey, <cite>To a Spider</cite> (ii. 180):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Spider! thou need’st not run in fear about</div>
    <div class="line indent4">To shun my curious eyes;</div>
    <div class="line">I wont humanely crush thy bowels out,</div>
    <div class="line indent4">Lest thou should’st eat the flies;</div>
    <div class="line">Nor will I roast thee with a damn’d  delight</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Thy strange instinctive fortitude to see,</div>
    <div class="line indent4">For there is One who might</div>
    <div class="line indent6">One day roast me.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A structure analogous to that of the two last-quoted specimens is
exhibited in many stanzas occurring in earlier Modern English poetry, as
in Cowley, Herbert, Browne, Carew (<em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub> d<sub>4</sub> d<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a<sub>5</sub>
b<sub>2</sub> c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>3</sub> d<sub>5</sub> d<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c c<sub>4</sub> d d<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c<sub>3</sub> c<sub>2</sub> d d<sub>3</sub></em>);
other forms, corresponding only in the upsong or downsong to the Middle
English stanza quoted above, are <em>a ~<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a ~<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c ~<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub> c ~<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>4</sub>
b ~<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b ~<sub>3</sub> b ~<sub>2</sub> b ~<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> b ~<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c d<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub></em>, &amp;c., used by
Burns, Moore, and Mrs. Hemans. For examples see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 417,
418.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_339" id="Pg_339" title="339"></a></p>

<p><a name="section278" id="section278"></a>
§ <b>278.</b> The next group consists of stanzas, one main part of which
consists of a half or of a whole tail-rhyme stanza. The first of these
two forms is used e.g. by Burns in the song <cite>She’s Fair and Fause</cite> (p.
204), where the stanza consists of four- and three-foot verses on the
model <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub></em>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">She’s fair and fause that causes my smart,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">I lo’ed her meikle and lang:</div>
    <div class="line">She’s broken her vow, she’s broken my heart,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">And I may e’en gae hang.</div>
    <div class="line indent4">A coof cam in wi’ rowth o’ gear,</div>
    <div class="line indent4">And I hae tint my dearest dear,</div>
    <div class="line indent4">But woman is but warld’s gear,</div>
    <div class="line indent6">Sae let the bonie lass gang.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Other stanzas of this class correspond to the formulas <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a a
a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a ~<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a ~<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c ~ c ~ c ~<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c c c<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em>. For
examples see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 419.</p>

<p>There is another form of stanza the first part of which according to the
Middle English usage consists of a complete tail-rhyme stanza (cf. the
ten-lined stanzas of this group), while the <em>cauda</em> is formed by a
rhyming couplet, so that its structure corresponds to the scheme <em>a a<sub>4</sub>
b<sub>3</sub> a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>4</sub></em>; it occurs in Spenser, <cite>Epigrams</cite>, ii (p. 586):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">As Diane hunted on a day,</div>
    <div class="line">She chaunst to come where Cupid lay,</div>

    <div class="line">With that Love wounded my Love’s hart</div>
    <div class="line">But Diane beasts with Cupid’s dart.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Similar stanzas of other metres are very frequently met with, as e.g.
stanzas corresponding to the formulas <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> d d<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c
c<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub> d d<sub>6</sub></em>, <em>a a<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>2</sub> b<sub>3</sub> b b<sub>7</sub></em>, and <em>a ~ a ~<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c ~ c ~<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> d d<sub>5</sub></em>.
The reverse order (i.e. <em>frons</em> + two <em>versus</em>) we have in <em>a a<sub>3</sub> b b<sub>2</sub>
c<sub>3</sub> b b<sub>2</sub> c<sub>3</sub></em> and <em>a a<sub>5</sub> b b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub> d d<sub>3</sub> e<sub>5</sub></em>. For examples see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §
420.</p>

<p>A stanza corresponding to the formula <em>a b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>3</sub> a b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> D<sub>3</sub></em> occurs in
M. Arnold’s <cite>The Church of Brou</cite> (p. 17)</p>

<p><a name="section279" id="section279"></a>
§ <b>279.</b> Among <b>stanzas of nine lines</b>, those with parallel rhymes must
again be mentioned first; as e.g. a strophe on the scheme <em>a a b b c c
d d<sub>4</sub> d<sub>5</sub></em>, in Akenside, Book I, Ode X, <cite>To the Muse</cite> (Poets, ix. 780).
Other stanzas occurring also in more<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_340" id="Pg_340" title="340"></a> recent poetry (Wordsworth, W.
Scott) are on the schemes <em>a a b b<sub>4</sub> c c<sub>2</sub> c d d<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a a b b c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>4</sub>
d<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c d D<sub>4</sub></em>. For examples see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 421.</p>

<p>Similar stanzas, also with an isometrical first part, but with crossed
rhymes, are not very often met with. The schemes are <em>a b a b<sub>4</sub> c c<sub>2</sub> c d
d<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a b a b c c d d<sub>4</sub> d<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a b a b b c b b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a b a b c d c d<sub>4</sub>
e<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c ~ d c ~ d<sub>4</sub></em>, &amp;c. Specimens of them are also found
in modern poets, as in Moore, Burns, Walter Scott, &amp;c. For examples see
<cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 422.</p>

<p>More frequently stanzas occur with an anisometrical first and last part
and crossed rhymes in each of them; the schemes are <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub>
c<sub>5</sub> d d<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c c<sub>5</sub> d d<sub>2</sub> c<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c<sub>4</sub> d d<sub>2</sub> c c<sub>4</sub></em>. The
most popular, however, are those stanzas in which one or other of the
two main parts consists of Septenary verses; they are of frequent
occurrence in Burns and other modern poets; a stanza on the scheme <em>a<sub>4</sub>
b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> d ~<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> d ~<sub>3</sub> r<sub>2</sub></em>, e.g., is found in Burns, <cite>The Holy Fair</cite>
(p. 14):</p>

<p>For similar examples see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 424.</p>

<p>Other stanzas are formed by combination with a complete or a shortened

§ <b>280.</b> Among the <b>stanzas of ten lines</b>, those with an isometrical

<p>The shorter, Septenary part of the stanza represents the <em>frons</em>, the
tail-rhyme stanza, the <em>versus</em>. Of a similar form (<em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub>
a b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>2</sub></em>) is the stanza of the poem <cite>An Orison of our Lady</cite> (E. E. T.
S., vol. xlix, p. 158). In Modern English also allied forms occur; one
especially with the scheme <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c d e e<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub></em> in Gray, <cite>Ode on
the Spring</cite> (Poets, x. 215); other forms are <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>2</sub> d<sub>3</sub> e e<sub>2</sub>
d<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c d e e<sub>4</sub> d<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> d d<sub>4</sub> e<sub>3</sub> f f<sub>4</sub> e<sub>3</sub></em>. (For
examples see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 432.)

The reverse combination, viz. tail-rhyme stanza and Septenary (on the
scheme <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> d<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> d<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>), also occurs in Middle English
times<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>), e.g. in Wright’s <cite>Spec. of Lyr. Poetry</cite>, p. 87:</p>

<p>Similar stanzas occur also in Modern English; e.g. one on the formula

p. 189.</p>

<p>Other ten-line stanzas consisting chiefly of Septenary verses or of
<cite>Poulter’s Measure</cite> correspond to the formulas <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub>

examples, partly taken from Moore, see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 435.</p>

<p>Stanzas of this kind consisting of five-foot verses are rarely met with,

<p><a name="section282" id="section282"></a>
§ <b>282.</b> Stanzas of eleven lines= are also rare. There is one with an
isometrical first part (on the scheme <em>a b a b<sub>5</sub> c c<sub>2</sub> c<sub>3</sub> d<sub>2</sub> d<sub>5</sub> x<sub>2</sub> d<sub>6</sub></em>)
in Ben Jonson, <cite>Cynthia’s Revels</cite> (Poets, iv. 610); another in
Campbell’s <cite>Gertrude of Wyoming</cite> (st. xxxv-xxxix), corresponding to the
scheme <em>a b a b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>3</sub> d d d<sub>4</sub> c<sub>3</sub> e e<sub>4</sub></em>.</p>

<p>Other stanzas of an almost entirely anisometrical structure consist of a
combination with a tail-rhyme stanza, as e.g. a Middle English stanza
on the scheme <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>, with a regular tail-rhyme
stanza representing the <em>pedes</em>, and a shortened tail- rhyme stanza
representing the <em>cauda</em>; it occurs in the <cite>Towneley Mysteries</cite>, pp.
221&ndash;3. A similar one we have in Phineas Fletcher (<cite>Poets</cite>, iv. 460) on
the formula

    <em>a ~<sub>2</sub> a ~<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub> e ~<sub>2</sub> e ~<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub> d ~<sub>4</sub> e ~ e ~<sub>2</sub> d d<sub>5</sub></em>,

§ <b>283. Stanzas of twelve lines</b> are very numerous. One of the Middle
English period we have in Wright’s <cite>Spec. of Lyr. Poetry</cite>, p. 27; it is
formed on the scheme <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> b b b c<sub>3</sub> D D D<sub>4</sub> C<sub>3</sub></em> and is similar to
those ten-lined stanzas mentioned above, which consist of two Septenary
verses and a tail-rhyme stanza; the second part of which, being the
refrain, thus becomes the <em>cauda</em> of the stanza. In the Modern English
period some simple stanzas with an isometrical first part and parallel
rhymes may be mentioned in the first place. These are constructed on the
schemes <em>a a b b c c d d<sub>4</sub> e<sub>4</sub> f<sub>2</sub> e<sub>4</sub> f<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>a a b b c c d d e e f<sub>4</sub> f<sub>3</sub></em> and
occur in Mrs. Hemans (iv. 171; vii. 155); stanzas of this kind with
crossed rhymes are likewise met with, e.g. <em>a ~ b a ~ b<sub>4</sub> c c<sub>3</sub> d<sub>5</sub> e e f
f<sub>3</sub> d<sub>5</sub></em> in Burns, p. 188.</p>

<p>Pretty often we find stanzas for singing, the <em>cauda</em> of which is
enclosed by the <em>pedes</em>; in the first stanza the two <em>pedes</em> together
form the refrain, in the others, however, only the last one, e.g. in
stanzas on the schemes <em>A ~ B A ~ B<sub>4</sub> c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub> A ~ B A ~ B<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>e ~ f e

<p>Similar stanzas of Septenary metres, also common in Moore, have the

B<sub>3</sub> A<sub>4</sub> B<sub>3</sub></em> (st. ii); only in st. i the <em>cauda</em> is in the middle; in the
others it closes the stanza (<cite>Nets and Cages</cite>).</p>

<p>Other stanzas have the reverse order of verses, as e.g. stanzas on the

This sort of stanza also occurs in Moore with other metres, e.g.
according to the formulas <em>A<sub>4</sub> B<sub>2</sub> A<sub>4</sub> B<sub>2</sub> c<sub>3</sub> d<sub>2</sub> c<sub>3</sub> d<sub>2</sub> A<sub>4</sub> B<sub>2</sub> A<sub>4</sub> B<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>e<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub>

<span class="subtitle">MODERN STANZAS AND METRES OF FIXED FORM

<span class="subtitle">STANZAS OF THREE AND MORE PARTS<br />
  CONSISTING OF UNEQUAL PARTS ONLY</span></h3>

<p><a name="section287" id="section287"></a>
§ <b>287. Introductory remark.</b> At the very beginning of the Modern
English period the poetry of England was strongly influenced by that of
Italy. Among the strophic forms used by the Italian poets, two
especially have had an important share in the development of English
metre: the sonnet and the canzone. Apart from those direct imitations
which we shall have to notice later, the sonnet form tended to make more
popular the use of enclosing rhymes, which had until then been only
sparingly employed in English poetry; while the canzone with its varied
combinations of anisometrical verses, mostly of eleven and seven
syllables, gave rise to a variety of similar loosely constructed
stanzas, as a rule, of three- and five-foot verses.</p>

<p>At the same time, however, these Modern English stanzas of a somewhat
loose structure were also affected by the stricter rules for the
formation of stanzas which had come down from the Middle English period.
Hence their structure frequently reminds us of the older forms, two
adjoining parts being often closely related, either by order of rhymes,
or by the structure of the verse, or by both together, though the old
law of the equality of the two <em>pedes</em> or of the two <em>versus</em> is not
quite strictly observed.</p>

<p>This explains the fact that some stanzas (especially the shorter ones)
have a structure similar to that of the old tripartite stanzas; while
others (chiefly the longer ones) not unfrequently consist of four or
even more parts.</p>

<p>In the first group the chief interest centres round those which have
enclosing rhymes in their first or last part. Although the transposition
of the order of rhymes thus effected in the <em>pedes</em><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_349" id="Pg_349" title="349"></a> or in the <em>versus</em>
was common both in Northern French and Provençal poets,<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> the
teachers of the Middle English poets, we find scarcely a single example
of it in Middle English, and it seems to have become popular in Modern
English only through the influence of the Italian sonnet.</p>

<p>In accordance with the analogy of the isometrical stanzas or parts of
stanzas this arrangement of rhymes is found also in the anisometrical
ones; so that we have first parts (<em>pedes</em>) both on the scheme <em>a b b a4</em>,
<em>a b b a<sub>5</sub></em> or <em>a<sub>4</sub> b b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub> b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>5</sub></em>. From the arrangement of rhymes
this order was transferred to the lines themselves; thus a stanza with
enclosing rhymes consisting of two longer lines with a couplet of short
lines between them, as in the last example, is transformed into a
similar stanza with crossed rhymes according to the formula <em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>4</sub>
b<sub>5</sub></em>, the shorter lines being, as before, placed between the longer ones
(or vice versa <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub></em>). It is evident that here too in spite of
the regular arrangement of rhymes the two <em>pedes</em> are not alike, but
only similar to each other.</p>

§ <b>288. Six-lined stanzas</b> of this kind, with an isometrical first part
or isometrical throughout, occur pretty often; one e.g. on the scheme
<em>a b b a c c<sub>4</sub></em> is met with in John Scott, <cite>Ode</cite> XIX (<cite>Poets</cite>, xi. 757):</p>

<p>For similar stanzas according to the formulas <em>a b b a a b<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a b b a c
c<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a b b a c<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub></em> (Milton, <cite>Psalm</cite> IV), <em>a b b a<sub>5</sub> c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub></em>, and <em>a b b
a c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub></em>, see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 456.</p>

<p>Other stanzas have anisometrical first and last parts; as e.g. one on
the model <em>a<sub>5</sub> b b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>5</sub> c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>3</sub></em> which was used by Cowley, <cite>Upon the
shortness of Man’s Life</cite> (Poets, v. 227):</p>

</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_350" id="Pg_350" title="350"></a></p>

<p>Similar stanzas are found in later poets, as e.g. Mrs. Hemans, D. G.
Rossetti, Mrs. Browning, corresponding to <em>a<sub>5</sub> b b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>5</sub> c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>3</sub> b b<sub>5</sub>
a<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>5</sub> b b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> a<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a b<sub>3</sub> b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>4</sub></em>,
&amp;c. (For specimen see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 458.)</p>

<p>Even more frequently we have stanzas of three quite heterogeneous parts;
the lines rhyming crosswise, parallel, or crosswise and parallel. They
occur both in the earlier poets (Cowley, Herbert, &amp;c.) and in those of
recent times (Southey, Wordsworth, Shelley, the Brownings, Swinburne,
&amp;c.). A song by Suckling (<cite>Poets</cite>, iii. 730) on the scheme <em>a<sub>3</sub> a b b<sub>2</sub> c
c<sub>4</sub></em> may serve as an example:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

c c<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b b c<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>5</sub> a<sub>3</sub> b b c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>2</sub> a b b c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>1</sub></em>, &amp;c.) see
<cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §459.</p>

<p>Very often we find stanzas of combined crossed and parallel rhymes; one
e.g. on the model <em>a b a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>6</sub> c c<sub>5</sub></em> in Shelley, <cite>A Summer-Evening
Churchyard</cite> (i. 160):</p>

for specimens see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 460&ndash;3.</p>

<p>Stanzas consisting of shorter lines are not so often met with; we have
an example (on the model <em>a b a<sub>2</sub> b c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>3</sub></em>) consisting of
iambic-anapaestic verses in R. Browning, <cite>On the Cliff</cite> (vi. 48):</p>

§ <b>289.</b> Among <b>seven-line</b> stanzas, both in earlier (Ph. Fletcher, S.
Daniel, &amp;c.) and more recent poets (Mrs. Browning, Swinburne, R.
Browning, D.G. Rossetti), those which are entirely isometrical occur
often. One on the model <em>a b b a b b a<sub>5</sub></em> is met with in S. Daniel’s
<cite>Epistle to the Angel Spirit of the most excellent Sir Philip Sidney</cite>
(Poets, iii. 228):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<em>a b b a a c c<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a b b a a c c<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a b b a c c a<sub>5</sub></em>, and <em>a b c c d d

<p>Anisometrical stanzas on the model <em>a b b a</em> in the first part occur
only in single examples, one corresponding to the scheme <em>a b b a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>2</sub> c

a<sub>3</sub> c c a<sub>5</sub></em> in Mrs. Hemans, <cite>The Festal Hour</cite> (ii. 247); cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>,
ii, § 466.</p>

<p>Sometimes quite anisometrical stanzas with parallel rhymes occur,
especially in the earlier poets, as e.g. in Wyatt, Suckling, Cowley; a
stanza of Cowley’s poem, <cite>The Thief</cite> (Poets, v. 263), has the formula
<em>a<sub>5</sub> a b b c c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub></em>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 468.</p>

<p>Several other stanza-forms remind us by their structure and arrangement
of rhymes of certain shortened forms of the tail-rhyme stanza, e.g. one
in <cite>A Parting Song</cite> by Mrs. Hemans (vi. 189), on the scheme <em>A<sub>4</sub> B<sub>3</sub> c c d
d<sub>4</sub> B<sub>2</sub></em>:</p>

<p><a name="section290" id="section290"></a>
§ <b>290.</b> Most of the <b>eight-lined stanzas</b>, which on the whole are rare,
are similar to the tail-rhyme stanza, the scheme of which is carried out
in both parts, to which a third part is then added as the <em>cauda</em> (last
part).</p>

<p>Stanzas of this kind, used especially by Cowley, correspond to <em>a a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub>
c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> d d<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>5</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub> d<sub>4</sub> d<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>5</sub> a b c c b<sub>4</sub> d d<sub>5</sub></em>, and <em>a

<p>The half-stanzas (<em>pedes</em>) are separated by the <em>cauda</em> in a stanza on
the scheme <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c c d d<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub></em>, which occurs in Wordsworth, <cite>The
Pilgrim’s Dream</cite> (vi. 153):</p>

only a half-stanza of the tail-rhyme form can be recognized (cf.
<cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §475).</p>

<p>Sometimes an unequal part is inserted between two parts of a somewhat

Southey, R. Browning, and Rossetti, one half-stanza having enclosing
rhymes and the whole stanza partaking of a tripartite structure. We
find, e.g. the form <em>A b b a c d c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub></em> in D. G. Rossetti, <cite>A Little

§ <b>292.</b> The most important of the Modern English eight-lined stanzas,
however, is an isometrical one on a foreign model, viz. a stanza of
hendecasyllabic or rather five-foot verses corresponding to the Italian
<em>ottava rima</em>, on the scheme <em>a b a b a b c c</em>. This stanza, which has
always been very popular in Italian poetry, was introduced into English
by Wyatt and Surrey; in Surrey we have only an isolated specimen, in <cite>To
his Mistress</cite> (p. 32):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

poems, and by Drayton and Daniel for epic poems<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_355" id="Pg_355" title="355"></a> of some length. In
modern literature it has been used by Frere, Byron (<cite>Beppo, Don Juan</cite>),

<p>Other stanzas of Moore and others have the formulas <em>a a b a b c c c<sub>4</sub>

§ <b>294.</b> The <b>ten-line stanzas</b> are also based mostly on a combination
of earlier strophic systems. Thus in Campbell’s well-known poem, <cite>Ye
Mariners of England</cite> (p. 71), the <cite>Poulter’s Measure</cite> rhythm is
observable, the scheme being <em>a ~ b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub> . e<sub>4</sub> f<sub>3</sub> . e<sub>2</sub> F<sub>3</sub> G<sub>4</sub> F<sub>3</sub></em>:</p>

<p>Similar stanzas occurring in the works of earlier poets, as Sidney and
Spenser, correspond to the schemes <em>a<sub>6</sub> b a b b<sub>5</sub> c c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>2</sub> b<sub>5</sub> d<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>5</sub> a<sub>2</sub> b
~ c b ~ c D ~ D ~ E E<sub>3</sub></em>, &amp;c. But generally speaking most of the earlier
poets, as e.g. Donne, Cowley, and Suckling, prefer a simpler order of
rhymes, the schemes being <em>a a<sub>3</sub> b b . c<sub>5</sub> c c<sub>4</sub> . d d d<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>4</sub> a b b<sub>5</sub> c c<sub>4</sub>
d d e e<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>5</sub> a a<sub>2</sub> b b c d d<sub>3</sub> e e<sub>5</sub></em>, &amp;c.; the more modern poets (Moore,
Wordsworth, Swinburne), on the other hand, are fond of somewhat more
complicated forms, as <em>a<sub>4</sub> b ~ b ~<sub>2</sub> a a<sub>4</sub> c ~ c ~<sub>2</sub> d a d<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a b a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c
c<sub>5</sub> d e<sub>3</sub> d<sub>4</sub> e<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>a b b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>3</sub> c d d e d<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub></em>, &amp;c. (For specimens cf.
<cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 480, 481.) A fine form of stanza corresponding to the
formula <em>a b c b c<sub>5</sub> a<sub>3</sub> d e e d<sub>5</sub></em> is used by M. Arnold in his poem <cite>The
Scholar Gipsy</cite>, and another on the scheme <em>a a<sub>3</sub> b c c b<sub>5</sub> d<sub>3</sub> e d e<sub>5</sub></em> in
<cite>Westminster Abbey</cite>, p. 479.</p>

<p><a name="section295" id="section295"></a>
§ <b>295. Stanzas of eleven lines</b> do not frequently occur in earlier
poetry, and for the most part simple forms are employed, e.g. <em>a b<sub>4</sub> a b

c e e e<sub>5</sub></em>, &amp;c.; the more recent poets, however, as Moore, Wordsworth,
and R. Browning, have usually preferred a more intricate arrangement, as
<em>a ~ b c ~ d d a ~ b c ~<sub>2</sub> e e e<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a b c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> d e f f<sub>4</sub> e<sub>3</sub> g g<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub>
a b c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub> c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>3</sub> e<sub>2</sub> e<sub>3</sub> e<sub>4</sub></em>. The last scheme occurs in a song by Moore:</p>

</div>

<p><a name="section296" id="section296"></a>
§ <b>296. Stanzas of twelve lines</b> are more frequent, possibly on account
of the symmetrical arrangement of the stanza in equal parts, twelve
being divisible by three. They are constructed on different models, e.g.
<em>a a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> b a<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub> d<sub>5</sub> d c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub> e e<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b ~ b ~ c<sub>3</sub> c<sub>2</sub> d<sub>3</sub> d<sub>2</sub> e f<sub>3</sub> f<sub>1</sub>

earlier poets, such as Donne, Browne, Dryden, &amp;c. Similar stanzas,
partly of a simpler structure (<em>a b b a<sub>5</sub> a<sub>6</sub> c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> d d e<sub>4</sub> e<sub>5</sub></em>,<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_357" id="Pg_357" title="357"></a><em>a ~ b

tail-rhyme stanza, occurring in Tennyson (p. 12):</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="subtitle">THE SPENSERIAN STANZA AND FORMS DERIVED
  FROM IT</span></h3>

<p><a name="section297" id="section297"></a>
§ <b>297.</b> One of the most important Modern English stanzas is the
Spenserian, so called after its inventor. This stanza, like the forms
discussed in the last chapter, but in a still greater degree, is based
on an older type. For it is not, as is sometimes said, derived from the
Italian <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">ottava rima</em> (cf. § <a href="#section292">292</a>), but, as was pointed out by Guest (ii.
389), from a Middle English eight-lined popular stanza of five-foot
verses with rhymes on the formula <em>a b a b b c b c</em>, which was modelled
in its turn on a well-known Old French ballade-stanza (cf. § <a href="#section269">269</a>). To
this stanza Spenser added a ninth verse of six feet rhyming with the
eighth line, an addition which was evidently meant to give a very
distinct and impressive conclusion to the stanza.</p>

<p>As a specimen the first stanza of the first book of the <cite>Faerie Queene</cite>,
where it was used for the first time, may be quoted here:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">A gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Ycladd in mightie armes and silver shielde,</div>
    <div class="line">Wherein old dints of deepe woundes did remaine,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">The cruell markes of many a bloody fielde;</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Yet armes till that time did he never wield.</div>
    <div class="line">His angry steede did chide his foming bitt,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">As much disdayning to the curbe to yield:</div>
    <div class="line">Full jolly knight he seemd, and faire did sitt,</div>
    <div class="line">As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This euphonious stanza became very popular and has been used by many of
the chief Modern English poets, as e.g. by Thomson, <cite>The Castle of
Indolence</cite>; Shenstone, <cite>The School-Mistress</cite>; Burns, <cite>The Cotter’s
Saturday Night</cite>; Byron, <cite>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</cite>; Shelley, <cite>The
Revolt of Islam</cite>.</p>

<p>The great influence it had on the development of the different forms of
stanza, especially in the earlier Modern English period, is proved by
the numerous imitations and analogous formations which arose from it.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_359" id="Pg_359" title="359"></a></p>

<p><a name="section298" id="section298"></a>
§ <b>298.</b> All the imitations have this in common that they consist of a
series of two to ten five-foot lines followed by a concluding line of
six (or rarely seven) feet.</p>

<p>John Donne, Phineas Fletcher, and Giles Fletcher were, it seems, the
inventors of those varieties of stanza, the shortest of which consist of
three or four lines on the schemes <em>a a<sub>5</sub> a<sub>6</sub></em>, <em>a b a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>6</sub></em>, and were used
by Rochester, <cite>Upon Nothing</cite> (Poets, iv. 413), and Cowper (p. 406). A
stanza of five lines, however, on the model <em>a b a b<sub>5</sub> b<sub>6</sub></em> occurs in
Phineas Fletcher’s <cite>Eclogue II</cite>.</p>

<p>The favourite six-lined stanza with the formula <em>a b a b c c<sub>5</sub></em> (cf. §
<a href="#Pg_327">267, p. 327</a>) was often transformed into a quasi-Spenserian stanza <em>a b a
b c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>6</sub></em> by adding one foot to the last line, as e.g. by Dodsley in <cite>On
the Death of Mr. Pope</cite> (Poets, xi. 103), Southey, <cite>The Chapel Bell</cite> (ii.
143), and others; cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 493.</p>

<p>It was changed into a stanza of seven lines on the scheme <em>a b a b c c<sub>5</sub>
c<sub>6</sub></em> by Donne, <cite>The Good Morrow</cite> (Poets, iv. 24) by the addition of a
seventh line rhyming with the two preceding lines.</p>

<p>Much more artistic taste is shown by the transformation of the
seven-lined <em>rhyme royal</em> stanza <em>a b a b b c c<sub>5</sub></em> (cf. § <a href="#section268">268</a>) into a
quasi-Spenserian stanza <em>a b a b b c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>6</sub></em> in Milton’s <cite>On the Death of a
Fair Infant</cite>.</p>

<p>By the addition of a new line rhyming with the last couplet this form
was developed into the eight-lined stanza <em>a b a b b c c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>6</sub></em> employed
in Giles Fletcher’s <cite>Christ’s Victory and Triumph</cite>.</p>

<p>Omitting some rarer forms (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 495) we may mention that
Phineas Fletcher transformed the <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">ottava rima</em> <em>a b a b a b c c<sub>5</sub></em> into a
quasi-Spenserian stanza of the form <em>a b a b a b c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>6</sub></em>, and that he
also extended the same stanza to one of nine lines (<em>a b a b a b c c<sub>5</sub>
c<sub>6</sub></em>) by adding one verse more. Other nine-line quasi-Spenserian stanzas
occurring occasionally in modern poets, e.g. Mrs. Hemans, Shelley, and
Wordsworth, correspond to <em>a b a a b b c c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>6</sub></em>, <em>a b a b c d c d<sub>5</sub> d<sub>6</sub></em>,
<em>a b a b c c b d<sub>5</sub> d<sub>6</sub></em>, <em>a a b b c c d d<sub>5</sub> d<sub>6</sub></em>. (For specimens see
<cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 496.)

A stanza of ten lines on the scheme <em>a b a b c d c d e<sub>5</sub> e<sub>6</sub></em> was invented
by Prior for his <cite>Ode to the Queen</cite> (Poets, vii. 440); but it is not, as
he thought, an improved, but only a simplified form of the old
Spenserian scheme:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">When great Augustus govern’d  ancient Rome,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">And sent his conquering bands to foreign wars;</div>
    <div class="line">Abroad when dreaded, and belov’d  at home,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">He saw his fame increasing with his years;<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_360" id="Pg_360" title="360"></a></div>
    <div class="line">Horace, great bard! (so fate ordain’d) arose,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">And, bold as were his countrymen in fight,</div>
    <div class="line">Snatch’d their fair actions from degrading prose,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">And set their battles in eternal light:</div>
    <div class="line">High as their trumpets’ tune his lyre he strung,</div>
    <div class="line">And with his prince’s arms he moraliz’d  his song.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This stanza has been used by some subsequent poets, e.g. by Chatterton,
who himself invented a similar imitation of the old Spenserian form,
viz. <em>a b a b b a b a c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>6</sub></em>. Other stanzas of ten lines are <em>a b a b b
c d c d<sub>5</sub> d<sub>6</sub></em>, <em>a b b a c d d c e<sub>5</sub> e<sub>6</sub></em>, <em>a b a b c c d e e<sub>5</sub> d<sub>6</sub></em>. (For
specimens see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 497.)

A stanza of eleven lines on the scheme <em>a b a b c d c d c d<sub>5</sub> d<sub>6</sub></em> occurs
in Wordsworth in the <cite>Cuckoo-clock</cite> (viii. 161)</p>

<p><a name="section299" id="section299"></a>
§ <b>299.</b> Amongst the stanzaic formations analogous to the Spenserian
stanza, which for the most part were invented by the poets just
mentioned, two different groups are to be distinguished; firstly,
stanzas the body of which consists of four-foot (seldom three-foot)
verses, a six-foot final verse being added to them either immediately or
preceded by a five-foot verse; secondly, stanzas of anisometrical
structure in the principal part, the end-verse being of six or sometimes
of seven feet.</p>

<p>The stanzas of the first group consist of four to ten lines, and have
the following formulas: four-lined stanzas, <em>a b c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>6</sub></em> (Wordsworth);
five lines, <em>a b a b<sub>3</sub> b<sub>6</sub></em> (Shelley); six lines, <em>a b a a b<sub>3</sub> b<sub>6</sub></em> (Ben Jonson),
<em>a b a b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>6</sub></em> (Wordsworth, Coleridge), <em>a a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c c<sub>3</sub> b<sub>6</sub></em> (R.
Browning); seven lines, <em>a ~ b b a ~ c c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>7</sub></em> (Mrs. Browning); eight
lines, <em>a b a b c c d<sub>4</sub> d<sub>6</sub></em> (Gray, Wordsworth), <em>a a b b c c d<sub>4</sub> d<sub>6</sub></em> (John
Scott), <em>a a b b c c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>5</sub> d<sub>6</sub></em> (Coleridge); nine lines, <em>a b a b c d c<sub>4</sub> d<sub>5</sub>
c<sub>6</sub></em> and <em>a b a b c c d d<sub>4</sub> d<sub>6</sub></em> (Akenside), <em>a b a b b c b c<sub>4</sub> c<sub>6</sub></em>
(Shelley, <cite>Stanzas written in Dejection</cite>, i. 370); ten lines, <em>a b a b c
d c d<sub>4</sub> e<sub>5</sub> e<sub>6</sub></em> (Whitehead).</p>

<p>As an example we quote a stanza of nine lines from Shelley’s poem
mentioned above:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">I see the Deep’s untrampled floor</div>
    <div class="line indent2">With green and purple seaweeds strown;</div>
    <div class="line">I see the waves upon the shore,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Like light dissolved in star-showers, thrown:</div>
    <div class="line">I sit upon the sands alone,</div>
    <div class="line">The lightning of the noon-tide ocean</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Is flashing round me, and a tone</div>
    <div class="line">Arises from its measured motion,</div>
    <div class="line">How sweet! did any heart now share in my emotion.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>For other examples see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 499&ndash;503.<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_361" id="Pg_361" title="361"></a>.</p>

<p><a name="section300" id="section300"></a>
§ <b>300.</b> Greater variety is found in the second group; they have an
extent of four up to sixteen lines and mostly occur in poets of the
sixteenth to eighteenth centuries (Donne, Ben Jonson, Cowley, Rowe,
Akenside, &amp;c.), rarely in the nineteenth century. Stanzas of four lines
are, <em>a<sub>5</sub> a b<sub>4</sub> b<sub>6</sub></em> (Poets, v. 236), <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> b<sub>6</sub></em> (ib. xi. 1207); of five
lines, <em>a<sub>5</sub> a b<sub>3</sub> b<sub>4</sub> a<sub>6</sub></em> (ib. v. 281), <em>a b a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>4</sub> b<sub>6</sub></em> (ib. ix. 312), &amp;c.;
of six lines, <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>5</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>6</sub></em> (ib. xi. 130), <em>a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>6</sub></em> (ib.
x. 722), <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>4</sub> b<sub>6</sub></em> (ib. xi. 1070; tail-rhyme stanza), <em>a b<sub>5</sub> a<sub>4</sub> b
c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>6</sub></em> (Tennyson, <cite>The Third of February</cite>); of seven lines, <em>a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>4</sub>
c c<sub>3</sub> c<sub>6</sub></em> (Poets, v. 413), <em>a b a b<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>6</sub></em> (Mrs. Hemans, <cite>Easter
Day</cite>, vii. 165, with rhymes in the <em>rhyme royal</em> order; of eight lines,
<em>a a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c c<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> d<sub>4</sub> d<sub>6</sub></em> (Milton, <cite>Hymn on the Nativity</cite>, ii. 400;
tail-rhyme + <em>d<sub>4</sub> d<sub>6</sub></em>), <em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a b<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub> d<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub> d<sub>7</sub></em> (Poets, iv. 36), <em>a<sub>5</sub> a<sub>4</sub>

Elidure</cite>, vi. 47, and <cite>’Tis said that some have died for love</cite>, ii. 184,
beginning with the second stanza).</p>

<p>The following stanza from the last-mentioned poem may serve as a

<p>This last stanza has an exceedingly fine structure, consisting of an
isometrical first part and an anisometrical tail-rhyme<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_362" id="Pg_362" title="362"></a> stanza + an

<p>The three stanzas last quoted, as well as some of the shorter ones
occurring in Akenside, Rowe, &amp;c., were also used for odes, and in this
way the affinity of formations like these with the odic stanzas to be

<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="subtitle">THE EPITHALAMIUM STANZA AND OTHER ODIC STANZAS</span></h3>

<p><a name="section301" id="section301"></a>
§ <b>301.</b> The Spenserian stanza stands in unmistakable connexion with
Spenser’s highly artistic and elaborate <b>Epithalamium stanza</b> (Globe Ed.
587&ndash;91) inasmuch as the last line, <em>That all the woods may answer and
their echo ring</em>, repeated in each stanza as a burden together with the
word <em>sing</em> which ends the preceding verse, has six measures, the rest
of the stanza consisting of three- and five-foot lines.</p>

<p>Like the Spenserian stanza, the Epithalamium stanza has given rise to
numerous imitations.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that one fixed form of stanza is employed throughout
the whole extent of Spenser’s Epithalamium. It rather consists of two
main forms of stanza, viz. one of eighteen lines (st. i, ii, iv, v, vi,
x, xvi, xxi, xxiii), and one of nineteen lines (st. iii, vii, viii, ix,
xi, xii, xiii, xiv, xvii, xviii, xix, xx, xxii), whereas one stanza, the
fifteenth, has only seventeen lines. In the arrangement of rhymes there
are also sporadic varieties: cf. e.g. iv and ix.</p>

<p>The arrangement of verse, however, is always similar in both groups. The
main part of the stanza consists of five-foot verses, the succession of
which is interrupted three times by three-foot ones, the final verse of
the stanza having six measures. In the stanza of eighteen lines the
usual arrangement is <em>a b a b c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub> d c d e<sub>5</sub> e<sub>3</sub> f g g f<sub>5</sub> g<sub>3</sub> r<sub>5</sub> R<sub>6</sub></em>. In
those of nineteen lines it is <em>a b a b c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub> d c d e<sub>5</sub> e<sub>3</sub> f g g f h<sub>5</sub> h<sub>3</sub>
r<sub>5</sub> R<sub>6</sub></em>. The scheme of the stanza of seventeen lines is <em>a b a b c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub>
d c d e f f g h<sub>5</sub> h<sub>3</sub> r<sub>5</sub> R<sub>6</sub></em>.</p>

<p>The two following stanzas (ii, iii) may be quoted as specimens of the
two chief forms:</p>

    <div class="line">The woods shall to you answer, and your Eccho ring.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>These stanzas evidently consist of three or four unequal parts, the two
first parts (ll. 1&ndash;6, 7&ndash;11) being connected by rhyme. There is a certain
similarity between them, the chief difference being that the second
<em>pes</em>, as we may call it, is shortened by one verse. With the third
part, a new system of verses rhyming together commences, forming a kind
of last part (<em>downsong</em> or <em>cauda</em>); and as the final couplet of the
stanza is generally closely connected in sense with this, the assumption
of a tri<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_365" id="Pg_365" title="365"></a>partite division of the stanza is preferable to that of a
quadripartite division.</p>

<p><a name="section302" id="section302"></a>
§ <b>302.</b> Stanzas of this kind have also been used by later poets in
similar poems. But all these imitations of the Epithalamium stanza are
shorter than their model. As to their structure, some of them might also
be ranked among the irregular Spenserian stanzas, as they agree with
those in having a longer final verse of six or seven measures. But as a
rule, they have&mdash;not to speak of the similarity of theme&mdash;the
combination of three- and five-foot verses in the principal part, on the
model, it seems, of Spenser’s Epithalamium stanza.</p>

<p>Stanzas of this kind (eight lines up to fourteen) occur in Donne and Ben
Jonson; the schemes <span class="locked">being&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Stanzas similar in subject and structure, but without the longer
end-verse, may be treated here, as well as some odic stanzas similar in
structure (9&ndash;18 lines) and in theme, occurring in earlier poets, as e.g.
Sidney, Spenser, John Donne, Samuel Daniel, Ben Jonson, Drummond, and
Milton. In Modern English poetry there are only some few examples of
such stanzas to be met with in translations of Italian canzones; e.g.
in Leigh Hunt. The schemes are as follows. Stanzas of nine lines, <em>a b a
b<sub>5</sub> b c<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub> d<sub>3</sub> D<sub>5</sub></em> (Sidney, <cite>Arcadia</cite>, p. 388); of ten lines, <em>a a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub>
c<sub>5</sub> c d d<sub>3</sub> e e<sub>5</sub></em> (Ben Jonson, <cite>Ode to himself</cite>, Poets, iv. 607); of
eleven lines, <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b<sub>3</sub> b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub> D<sub>3</sub> D<sub>2</sub> E<sub>3</sub> E<sub>2</sub> d<sub>5</sub></em> (ib. 611); of twelve
lines, <em>a<sub>2</sub> b<sub>5</sub> b<sub>2</sub> a c c<sub>5</sub> d d<sub>3</sub> e<sub>5</sub> f<sub>3</sub> f<sub>5</sub> e<sub>2</sub></em> (ib. 572), <em>a<sub>3</sub> a b<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>5</sub> d<sub>3</sub>
d e<sub>5</sub> e<sub>3</sub> f f<sub>5</sub></em> (Drummond, ib. 664); of thirteen lines,
   <em>a b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>5</sub> c b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub> c d e e<sub>3</sub> d<sub>5</sub> f<sub>3</sub> f<sub>5</sub></em> (Sidney, <cite>Arcadia</cite>, p. 394),
<em>a b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub> a b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub> c d e e<sub>3</sub> d<sub>5</sub> f<sub>3</sub> f<sub>5</sub></em> (S. Daniel, <cite>The Pastoral</cite>, Poets,
 iv. 225), agreeing in form with the eleventh of Petrarch’s canzones,
<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Chiare, fresche e dolci acque</em>, translated by Leigh Hunt (p. 394) on
the scheme, <em>a a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c c<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> b d d<sub>3</sub> e<sub>4</sub> e<sub>5</sub> f<sub>4</sub> f<sub>5</sub></em>; of fourteen lines,
<em>a b c b a c c<sub>5</sub> d d<sub>3</sub> c e<sub>5</sub> f<sub>3</sub> f<sub>2</sub> e<sub>3</sub></em> (Milton, <cite>Upon the Circumcision</cite>,
ii. 408); of eighteen lines, <em>a b b a<sub>5</sub> a<sub>3</sub> c d c d<sub>5</sub> d<sub>3</sub> e e f e<sub>5</sub> f f<sub>3</sub> G
G<sub>5</sub></em> (Spenser, <cite>Prothalamium</cite>, p. 605). For examples of these stanzas,
partly formed on the model of the Italian canzones, see <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii,
§§ 512&ndash;15</p>

<p><a name="section303" id="section303"></a>
§ <b>303.</b> The English odic stanzas have been influenced too, although
only in a general way, by the anisometrical structure of the Greek odes.
This, however, was only to a slight extent the case in the so-called
<b>Pindaric Odes</b>, as the metres usually employed in them were essentially
the same, and retained in their composition the same anisometrical
character exhibited by the odic stanzas considered in the preceding
paragraphs.</p>

<p>There are, however, two groups of Pindaric Odes, viz. Regular and
Irregular, and it is chiefly the latter group to which the preceding
remark refers.</p>

<p>The irregular odes were possibly modelled on certain non-strophical
poems or hymns, consisting of anisometrical verses throughout, with an
entirely irregular system of rhymes. We have an example of them already
in the poems of Donne, the inventor or imitator of some odic stanzas
mentioned in the previous paragraph; it is in his poem <cite>The Dissolution</cite>
(Poets, iv. 38) consisting of twenty-two rhyming verses of two to seven
measures on the model</p>

<p class="center"><em>a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>4</sub> c<sub>5</sub> d ~<sub>3</sub> b<sub>4</sub> a c<sub>5</sub> d ~<sub>3</sub> e<sub>4</sub> e<sub>5</sub> f<sub>3</sub> f<sub>5</sub> e<sub>5</sub> g<sub>4</sub> g<sub>5</sub> h<sub>3</sub> h<sub>4</sub> i i<sub>5</sub> k<sub>3</sub> l<sub>2</sub> l k<sub>5</sub> k<sub>7</sub></em>.</p>

<p>A similar form is found in Milton’s poems <cite>On Time</cite> (ii. 411) and <cite>At a
Solemn Music</cite> (ii. 412). Other examples taken from later poets are
quoted in <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 523. M. Arnold’s poems <cite>The Voice</cite> (second
half) (p. 36) and <cite>Stagirius</cite> (p. 38) likewise fall under this head.</p>

<p>To the combined influence of the earlier somewhat lengthy unstrophical
odes on the one hand, and of the shorter, strophical ones also composed
of anisometrical verses on the other, we have possibly to trace the
particular odic form which was used by Cowley when he translated, or
rather paraphrased, the Odes of Pindar. Owing to Cowley’s popularity,
this form came much into fashion afterwards through his numerous
imitators, and it is much in vogue even at the present day.</p>

<p>The characteristic features of Cowley’s free renderings and imitations
of Pindar’s odes are, in the first place, that he dealt very freely with
the matter of his Greek original, giving only the general sense with
arbitrary omissions and additions; and, in the second place, he paid no
attention to the characteristic strophic structure of the original,
which is a system of stanzas recurring in the same order till the end of
the poem, and consisting of two stanzas of identical form, the strophe
and antistrophe, followed by a third, the epode, entirely differing from
the two others in structure. In this respect Cowley did not even attempt
to imitate the original poems, the metres<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_367" id="Pg_367" title="367"></a> of which were very
imperfectly understood till long after his time.</p>

<p>Hence there is a very great difference between the originals and the
English translations of Cowley, a difference which is clear even to the
eye from the inequality of the number of stanzas and the number of
verses in them.</p>

<p><a name="section304" id="section304"></a>
§ <b>304.</b> The first Nemean ode, e.g. consists of four equal parts, each
one being formed of a strophe and antistrophe of seven lines, and of a
four-lined epode; twelve stanzas in all. Cowley’s translation, on the
other hand, has only nine stanzas, each of an entirely different
structure, their schemes being as follows:</p>

<p>All the stanzas are of unequal length and consist of the most<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_368" id="Pg_368" title="368"></a> various
verses (of three, four, mostly five, even six and seven measures) and
arrangements of rhymes. Parallel rhymes are very common; but sometimes
we have crossed, enclosing, and other kinds of rhyme, as e.g. the
system of the Italian <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">terzina</em>. A characteristic feature is that at
the end of the stanza very often three parallel rhymes occur, and that,
as a rule, the stanza winds up with a somewhat longer line of six or
seven measures, as in the Spenserian and the Epithalamium stanza; but
sometimes we also find a short final verse.</p>

<p>To these Irregular Pindaric Odes, besides, belong Dryden’s celebrated
odes <cite>Threnodia Augustalis</cite> and <cite>Alexander’s Feast</cite>, the latter having a
more lyrical form, with a short choral strophe after each main stanza;
and Pope’s <cite>Ode on St. Cecilia’s Day</cite>. A long list of references to
similar poems from Cowley to Tennyson is given in <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§
516&ndash;22; amongst these different forms the rhymeless odic stanzas
occurring in Dr. Sayers (<cite>Dramatic Sketches</cite>), Southey (e.g. <cite>Thalaba</cite>)
and Shelley (<cite>Queen Mab</cite>) are noticeable.</p>

§ <b>305.</b> To these Irregular Pindaric Odes strong opposition was raised
by the dramatist Congreve, who in a special <cite>Discourse on the Pindaric
Ode</cite> (Poets, vii. 509) proved that Pindar’s odes were by no means
formed on the model of such an arbitrary strophic structure as that of
the so-called Pindaric Odes which had hitherto been popular in English
poetry. To refute this false view he explained and emphasized their
actual structure (see § <a href="#section303">303</a>), which he imitated himself in his Pindaric
Ode addressed to the Queen, written soon after May 20, 1706, and
composed in anisometrical rhyming verses. He was mistaken, however, in
thinking that he was the first to make this attempt in English. Nearly
a hundred years before him, Ben Jonson had imitated Pindar’s odic form
on exactly the same principles; in his <cite>Ode Pindaric</cite> to the memory
of Sir Lucius Carey and Sir H. Morison (<cite>Poets</cite>, iv. 585) we have the
strophe (<em>turn</em>), antistrophe (<em>counter-turn</em>nd the epode (<em>stand</em>),
recurring four times (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 525). Ben Jonson, however,
found no followers; so that his attempt had remained unknown even to
Congreve. The regular Pindaric Odes by this poet, on the other hand,
called forth a great many imitations of a similar kind and structure.
For this reason the first three stanzas of Congreve’s <cite>Pindaric Ode</cite>

<h3>CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="subtitle">THE SONNET</span></h3>

<p><a name="section306" id="section306"></a>
§ <b>306. Origin of the English Sonnet.</b> In early Provençal and French
poetry certain lyric poems are found which were called <cite>Son</cite>, sometimes
<cite>Sonet</cite>, although they had neither a fixed extent, nor a regulated
form. But the Sonnet<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> in its exact structure was introduced into
French, Spanish, and English poetry from Italian, and as a rule on
the model, or at least under the influence, of Petrarch’s sonnets. In
English literature, however, the sonnet in part had a more independent
development than it had in other countries, and followed its Italian
model at first only in the number and nature of the verses used in it.
Generally speaking, the Italian and the English sonnet can be defined
as a short poem, complete in itself, consisting of fourteen five-foot
(or eleven-syllabled) iambic lines, in which a single theme, a thought
or series of thoughts, is treated and brought to a conclusion. In the
rhyme-arrangement and the structure of the poem, however, the English
sonnet, as a rule, deviates greatly from its Italian model, and the
examples in which its strict form is followed are comparatively rare.</p>

<p><a name="section307" id="section307"></a>
§ <b>307.</b> The Italian Sonnet consists of two parts distinguished from
each other by difference of rhymes, each of the parts having its own
continuous system of rhymes. The first part is formed of two quatrains
(<em>basi</em>), i.e. stanzas of four lines; the second of two terzetti
(<em>volte</em>), stanzas of three lines. The two quatrains have only two, the
terzetti two or three rhymes.</p>

<p>The usual rhyme-arrangement in the quatrains is <em>a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;a b b a</em>,
more rarely <em>a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;b a a b</em> (<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">rima chiusa</em>). There are, however,
also sonnets with alternate rhymes, <em>a b a b&nbsp;&nbsp;a b a b</em> or <em>a b a b&nbsp;&nbsp;b a b a</em>
(<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">rima alternata</em>); but the combination of the two kinds of rhyme,
<em>a b a b&nbsp;&nbsp;b a a b</em> or <em>a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;a b a b</em> (<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">rima mista</em>), was unusual.
In the second part, consisting of six lines, the order of rhymes is
not so definitely fixed. When only two rhymes are used, which the old
metrists, as Quadrio (1695&ndash;1756), the Italian<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_372" id="Pg_372" title="372"></a> critic and historian of
literature, regarded as the only legitimate method, the usual sequence
is <em>c d c&nbsp;&nbsp;d c d</em> (crossed rhymes, <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">rima alternata</em>). This form occurs 112
times in those of Petrarch’s<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> sonnets which have only two rhymes in
the last part, their number being 124; in the remaining twelve sonnets
the rhyme-system is either <em>c d d&nbsp;&nbsp;c d c</em> or <em>c d d&nbsp;&nbsp;d c c</em>. In the second part
of Petrarch’s sonnets three rhymes are commoner than two. In most cases
we have the formula <em>c d e&nbsp;&nbsp;c d e</em>, which occurs in 123 sonnets, while the
scheme <em>c d e&nbsp;&nbsp;d c e</em> is met with only in 78 sonnets. The three chief forms,
then, of Petrarch’s sonnet may be given with Tomlinson<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> as built on
the following models:</p>

<p class="center"><em>a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;c d e&nbsp;&nbsp;c d e</em>, <em>a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;c d c&nbsp;&nbsp;d c d</em>,<br />
                   <em>a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;c d e&nbsp;&nbsp;d c e.</em></p>

<p>In the seventy-second and seventy-fourth sonnet we have the unusual
schemes <em>c d e&nbsp;&nbsp;e d c</em> and <em>c d e&nbsp;&nbsp;d e c</em>. The worst form, according
to the Italian critics, was that which ended in a rhyming couplet.
This kind of ending, as we shall see later on, is one of the chief
characteristics of the specifically English form of the sonnet.</p>

<p>The original and oldest form of the sonnet, however, as recent inquiries
seem to show, was that with crossed rhymes both in the quatrains and
in the terzetti, on the scheme <em>a b a b&nbsp;&nbsp;a b a b&nbsp;&nbsp;c d c&nbsp;&nbsp;d c d</em>. But this
variety had no direct influence on the true English form, in which a
system of crossed rhymes took a different arrangement.</p>

<p>An essential point, then, in the Italian sonnet is the bipartition,
the division of it into two chief parts; and this rule is so strictly
observed that a carrying on of the sense, or the admission of
<em>enjambement</em> between the two main parts, connecting the eighth and
ninth verse of the poem by a run-on line, would be looked upon as a
gross offence against the true structure and meaning of this poetic
form. Nor would a run-on line be allowed between the first and the
second stanza; indeed some poets, who follow the strict form of the
sonnet, do not even admit <em>enjambement</em> between the first and the second
terzetto, although for the second main part of the poem this has never
become a fixed rule.</p>

<p>The logical import of the structure of the sonnet, as understood by the
earlier theorists, especially Quadrio, is this: The<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_373" id="Pg_373" title="373"></a> first quatrain
makes a statement; the second proves it; the first terzetto has to
confirm it, and the second draws the conclusion of the whole.</p>

<p><a name="section308" id="section308"></a>
§ <b>308.</b> The structure of this originally Italian poetic form may
be illustrated by the following sonnet, equally correct in form and
poetical in substance, in which Theodore Watts-Dunton sets forth the
essence of this form of poetry itself:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Sonnet’s Voice.</span></p>

      <div class="line indent2">A restless lore like that the billows teach;</div>
      <div class="line">For on these sonnet-waves my soul would reach</div>
      <div class="line indent2">From its own depths, and rest within you, dear,</div>
      <div class="line indent2">As, through the billowy voices yearning here,</div>
      <div class="line indent2">Great nature strives to find a human speech.</div>
    </div>

      <div class="line">Flows in the ‘octave’; then, returning free,</div>

      <div class="line indent2">Back to the deeps of Life’s tumultuous sea.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Although the run-on line between the terzetti is perhaps open
to a slight objection, the rhyme-arrangement is absolutely
correct, the inadmissible rhyming couplet at the end of the
poem being of course avoided. Other sonnets on the sonnet
written in English, German, or French, are quoted in <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii,
§ 534</p>

<p><a name="section309" id="section309"></a>
§ <b>309.</b> The first English sonnet-writers, Wyatt and Surrey,
departed considerably from this strict Italian form, although
they both translated sonnets written by Petrarch into English.
Their chief deviation from this model is that, while retaining the
two quatrains, they break up the second chief part of the sonnet,
viz. the terzetti, into a third quatrain (with separate rhymes)
and a rhyming couplet. Surrey went still further in the alteration
of the original sonnet by changing the arrangement and
the number of rhymes in the quatrains also, whereas Wyatt,
as a rule, in this respect only exceptionally deviated from the
structure of the Italian sonnet. The greater part of Wyatt’s
sonnets (as well as Donne’s, cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 541) have therefore<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_374" id="Pg_374" title="374"></a>
the scheme <em>abba abba cddc ee</em>, whereas other forms, as e.g.
<em>abba abba cd cd ee</em> occur only occasionally (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii,
§ 535).</p>

<p>This order of rhymes, on the other hand, was frequently used
by Sir Philip Sidney, who on the whole followed the Italian
model, and sometimes employed even more accurate Italian
forms, avoiding the final rhyming couplet (cf. ib. § 538). He
also invented certain extended and curtailed sonnets which are
discussed in <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 539, 540</p>

<p><a name="section310" id="section310"></a>
§ <b>310.</b> Of greater importance is Surrey’s transformation of the
Italian sonnet, according to the formula <em>abab cdcd efefgg</em>.
 This variety of the sonnet&mdash;which, we may note in passing,
Surrey also extended into a special poetic form consisting of
several such quatrains together with a final rhyming couplet
(cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 537)&mdash;was very much in favour in the sixteenth
and at the beginning of the seventeenth century. Samuel
Daniel, and above all Shakespeare, wrote their sonnets mainly<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
in this form, sometimes combining a series of them in a closely
connected cycle. As a specimen of this most important form
we quote the eighteenth of Shakespeare’s sonnets:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:</div>
    <div class="line">Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">And often is his gold complexion dimm’d;</div>
    <div class="line indent2">And every fair from fair sometime declines,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm’d;</div>
    <div class="line">But thy eternal summer shall not fade</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Nor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his shade,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:</div>
    <div class="line indent4">So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,</div>
    <div class="line indent4">So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Commonly the concluding couplet contains an independent thought which
gives a conclusion to the poem. In certain cases, however, the thought
of the previous stanza is carried on in the closing couplet by means of
a run-on line, as is the case in Nos. 71, 72, 108, 154, &amp;c. Sometimes,
of course, a run<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_375" id="Pg_375" title="375"></a>-on line connects different portions of the sonnet
also, as e.g. Nos. 114, 129, 154, &amp;c. The rhymes, as a rule, are
masculine, but not exclusively so.</p>

<p><a name="section311" id="section311"></a>
§ <b>311.</b> Meanwhile, another interesting form had been introduced,
perhaps by the Scottish poet, Alex. Montgomerie,<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> which was
subsequently chiefly used by Spenser. When about seventeen Spenser had
translated the sonnets of the French poet, Du Bellay, in blank verse,
and thereby created the rhymeless form of the sonnet, which, however,
although not unknown in French poetry, was not further cultivated. About
twenty years later he re-wrote the same sonnets in the form introduced
by Surrey. Some years after he wrote a series of sonnets, called
<cite>Amoretti</cite>, in that peculiar and very fine form which, although perhaps
invented by Montgomerie, now bears Spenser’s name. The three quatrains
in this form of the sonnet are connected by <em>concatenatio</em>, the final
verse of each quatrain rhyming with the first line of the next, while
the closing couplet stands separate. The scheme of this form, then, <em>a
b a b b c b c c d c d e e</em>; it found, however, but few imitators (cf.
<cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 542, 543, 559, note 1).</p>

<p>The various forms of Drummond of Hawthornden’s sonnets had also no
influence on the further development of this kind of poetry and
therefore need not be discussed here. It may suffice to say that he
partly imitated the strict Italian form, partly modified it; and that he
also used earlier English transformations and invented some new forms
(cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 547, 548)</p>

<p><a name="section312" id="section312"></a>
§ <b>312.</b> A new and important period in the history of sonnet writing,
although it was only of short duration, began with Milton. Not a single
one of his eighteen English and five Italian sonnets is composed on the
model of those by Surrey and Shakespeare or in any other genuine English
form. He invariably used the Italian rhyme-arrangement <em>a b b a a b
b a</em> in the quatrains, combined with the strict Italian order in the
terzetti: <em>c d c d c d</em>, <em>c d d c d c</em>, <em>c d e c d e</em>, <em>c d c e e d</em>, <em>c
d e d c e</em>; only in one English and in three Italian sonnets we find the
less correct Italian form with the final rhyming couplet on the schemes
<em>c d d c e e</em>, <em>c d c d e e</em>.</p>

<p>One chief rule, however, of the Italian sonnet, viz. the logical<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_376" id="Pg_376" title="376"></a>
separation of the two main parts by a break in the sense, is observed
by Milton only in about half the number of his sonnets; and the
above-mentioned relationship of the single parts of the sonnet to each
other according to the strict Italian rule (cf. pp. <a href="#Pg_372">372&ndash;3</a> and <cite>Metrik</cite>,
ii, § 533, pp. 839&ndash;40) is hardly ever met with in Milton. He therefore
imitated the Italian sonnet only in its form, and paid no regard to the
relationship of its single parts or to the distribution of the contents
through the quatrains and terzets. In this respect he kept to the
monostrophic structure of the specifically English form of the sonnet,
consisting, as a rule, of one continuous train of thought.</p>

<p>Milton also introduced into English poetry the playful variety of the
so-called tail-sonnet on the Italian model (<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sonetti codati</em>), a sonnet,
extended by six anisometrical verses, with the scheme <em>a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;c d e d e c<sub>5</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;c<sub>3</sub> f f<sub>5</sub> f<sub>3</sub> g g<sub>5</sub></em> (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 549),
which, however, did not attract many imitators (Milton, ii. 481&ndash;2).</p>

<p>After Milton sonnet-writing was discontinued for about a century. The
poets of the Restoration period and of the first half of the eighteenth
century (Cowley, Waller, Dryden, Pope, Gay, Akenside, Young, Thomson,
Goldsmith, Johnson, and others) did not write a single sonnet, and seem
to have despised this form of poetry (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 550)</p>

<p><a name="section313" id="section313"></a>
§ <b>313.</b> When sonnet-writing was revived in the second half of the
eighteenth century by T. Edwards, who composed some fifty sonnets,
by Gray, by Benjamin Stillingfleet, T. Warton, and others of less
importance, as well as by Charlotte Smith, Helen M. Williams, Anna
Seward, the male poets preferred the strict Italian form, while the
poetesses, with the exception of Miss Seward, adopted that of Surrey and
Shakespeare (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 551).</p>

<p>Not long afterwards another very popular and prolific sonnet-writer,
William Lisle Bowles, followed in some of his sonnets the strict Italian
model (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 552), but also wrote sonnets (towards the end
of the eighteenth century) on a scheme that had previously been used by
Drummond, viz. <em>a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;c d d c&nbsp;&nbsp;e f f e g g</em>, this formula representing
a transition form from the Italian to Surrey’s sonnet, with enclosing
rhymes in the quatrains instead of crossed rhymes (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §
546, p. 860).</p>

<p>Bowles’s example induced S. T. Coleridge to write his sonnets, which in
part combined in the quatrains enclosing and crossed rhyme (<em>a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;c d
c d&nbsp;&nbsp;e f e f g g</em> or <em>a b a b&nbsp;&nbsp;c d d c&nbsp;&nbsp;e f f e f e</em>; cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §
553).</p>

<p>Similar, even more arbitrary forms and rhyme-arrangements,<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_377" id="Pg_377" title="377"></a> the terzetti
being sometimes placed at the beginning (e.g. No. 13, <em>a a b c c b d e
d e f e f e</em>) of the poem, occur in Southey’s sonnets, which, fine as
they sometimes are in thought, have in their form hardly any resemblance
to the original Italian model except that they contain fourteen lines.
They had, however, like those of Drummond, no further influence, and
therefore need not be discussed here (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 554)</p>

<p><a name="section314" id="section314"></a>
§ <b>314.</b> A powerful impulse was given to sonnet-writing by Wordsworth,
who wrote about 500 sonnets, and who, not least on account of his
copiousness, has been called the English Petrarch. He, indeed, followed
his Italian model more closely than his predecessors with regard to the
form and the relationship of the different parts to each other.</p>

<p>The usual scheme of his quatrains is <em>a b b a, a b b a</em>, but there is
also a form with a third rhyme <em>a b b a, a c c a</em>, which frequently
occurs. The rhyme-arrangement of the terzetti is exceedingly various,
and there are also a great many sub-species with regard to the structure
of the first part. Very often the first quatrain has enclosing rhymes
and the second crossed rhymes, or vice versa; these being either formed
by two or three rhymes. As the main types of the Wordsworth sonnet the
following, which, however, admit of many variations in the terzetti, may
be mentioned: <em>a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;b a b a&nbsp;&nbsp;c d e&nbsp;&nbsp;c e d</em> (ii. 303), <em>a b
b a&nbsp;&nbsp;a b a b&nbsp;&nbsp;c d e&nbsp;e d c</em> (viii. 57), <em>a b a b&nbsp;&nbsp;b a a
b&nbsp;&nbsp;c d c&nbsp;&nbsp;d c d</em> (vi. 113), <em>a b a b&nbsp;&nbsp;a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;c d d&nbsp;&nbsp;c d
c</em> (viii. 29), <em>a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;a c a c&nbsp;&nbsp;d e e d e d</em> (vii. 82), <em>a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;c a c
a&nbsp;&nbsp;d e d e e d</em> (viii. 109) or <em>a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;c a c a&nbsp;&nbsp;d e d e f f</em>
(viii. 77), &amp;c., <em>a b a b&nbsp;&nbsp;b c c b&nbsp;&nbsp;d e f e f d</em> (vii. 29). There
are of this type also forms in which the terzetti have the structure <em>d
d f e e f</em> (vii. 334), or <em>d e f d e f</em> (viii. 68), &amp;c., and <em>a b a b&nbsp;&nbsp;a c a c&nbsp;&nbsp;d e d e d e</em> (viii. 28). Cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 555.</p>

<p>Very often Wordsworth’s sonnets differ from those of the Italian poets
and agree with the Miltonic type in that the two chief parts are not
separated from each other by a pause<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>; and even if there is no
run-on line the train of thought is continuous. For this reason his
sonnets give us rather the impression of a picture or of a description
than of a reflective poem following the Italian requirements, according
to which the sonnet should consist of: assertion (quatrain i), proof
(quatrain ii), confirmation (terzet i), conclusion (terzet ii) (cf. p.
373). The following sonnet by Wordsworth, strictly<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_378" id="Pg_378" title="378"></a> on the Italian model
in its rhyme-arrangement, may serve as an example:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">With Ships the sea was sprinkled far and nigh,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Like stars in heaven, and joyously it showed;</div>

    <div class="line indent2">Some veering up and down, one knew not why.</div>
    <div class="line">A goodly  Vessel did I then espy</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Come like a giant from a haven broad;</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Sonnets, however, like the following, entitled <cite>A Parsonage in
Oxfordshire</cite> (vi. 292), give to a still greater extent the impression of
monostrophic poems on account of the want of distinct separation between
the component parts:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Where holy ground begins, unhallowed ends,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Is marked by no distinguishable line;</div>
    <div class="line indent2">The turf unites, the pathways intertwine;</div>
    <div class="line indent2">And, wheresoe’er the stealing footstep tends,</div>
    <div class="line">Garden, and that Domain where kindreds, friends,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">And neighbours rest together, here confound</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Their several features, mingled like the sound</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Of many waters, or as evening blends</div>
    <div class="line">With shady night. Soft airs, from shrub and flower,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Waft fragrant greetings to each silent grave;</div>
    <div class="line indent2">And while those lofty poplars gently wave</div>
    <div class="line">Their tops, between them comes and goes a sky</div>
    <div class="line indent2">Bright as the glimpses of eternity,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">To saints accorded in their mortal hour.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The strophic character of many sonnets is still more visible both in
Wordsworth and some earlier poets (as e.g. Sidney or Shakespeare) when
several consecutive sonnets on the same subject are so closely connected
as to begin with the words <em>But</em> or <em>Nor</em>, as e.g. in Wordsworth’s
<cite>Ecclesiastical Sonnets</cite> (XI, XV, XVIII, XXIII); or when sonnets (cf.
the same collec<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_379" id="Pg_379" title="379"></a>tion, No. XXXII) end like the Spenserian stanza in an
Alexandrine. This peculiarity, which, of course, does not conform to the
strict and harmonious structure of the sonnet, and is found as early as
in a sonnet by Burns (p. 119), sometimes occurs in later poets also.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>

Wordsworth has had an undoubtedly great influence on the further
development of sonnet-writing, which is still extensively practised both
in England and America.</p>

<p><a name="section315" id="section315"></a>
§ <b>315.</b> None of the numerous sonnet-writers of the nineteenth century,
however, brought about a new epoch in this kind of poetry. They, as a
rule, confined themselves to either one or other of the four chief forms
noted above, viz.:</p>


<p>1. The specifically English form of Surrey and Shakespeare, used e.g. by
Keats, S. T. Coleridge, Mrs. Hemans, C. Tennyson Turner, Mrs. Browning,
M. Arnold (pp. 37, 38) (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 566).</p>

<p>2. The Wordsworth sonnet, approaching to the Italian sonnet in its
form or rather variety of forms; it occurs in S. T. Coleridge, Hartley
Coleridge, Sara Coleridge, Byron, Mrs. Hemans, Lamb, Tennyson, D. G.
Rossetti, M. Arnold (pp. 1&ndash;8) (cf. ib. §§ 561&ndash;2).</p>

<p>3. The Miltonic form, correct in its rhymes but not in the relationship
of its different parts to one another, used by Keats, Byron, Aubrey de
Vere, Lord Houghton, Mrs. Browning, Rossetti, Swinburne, and others (cf.
ib. § 563).</p>

<p>4. The strict Italian form, as we find it in Keats, Byron, Leigh Hunt,
Aubrey de Vere, Tennyson, Browning, Mrs. Browning, Austin Dobson,
Rossetti, Swinburne, M. Arnold (pp. 179&ndash;85), and most poets of the
modern school (cf. ib. §§ 564&ndash;5).</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="subtitle">
  OTHER ITALIAN AND FRENCH POETICAL FORMS
  OF A FIXED CHARACTER</span></h3>


<p><a name="section316" id="section316"></a>
§ <b>316.</b> The <b>madrigal</b>, an Italian form (It. <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">mandriale</em>,
<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">madrigale</em>, from <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">mandra</em> flock), is a pastoral song, a rural idyl.
The Italian madrigals of Petrarch, &amp;c., are short, isometrical poems
of eleven-syllable verses, consisting of two or three terzetti with
different rhymes and two or four other rhyming verses, mostly couplets:
<em>a b c&nbsp;&nbsp;a b c&nbsp;&nbsp;d d</em>,
<em>a b a&nbsp;&nbsp;b c b&nbsp;&nbsp;c c</em>,
<em>a b b&nbsp;&nbsp;a c c&nbsp;&nbsp;d d</em>,
<em>a b b&nbsp;&nbsp;c d d&nbsp;&nbsp;e e</em>,
<em>a b b&nbsp;&nbsp;a c c&nbsp;&nbsp;c d d</em>,
<em>a b a&nbsp;&nbsp;c b c&nbsp;&nbsp;d e&nbsp;&nbsp;d e</em>,
<em>a b b&nbsp;&nbsp;c d d&nbsp;&nbsp;e e&nbsp;&nbsp;f f</em>,
<em>a b b&nbsp;&nbsp;c d d&nbsp;&nbsp;e f f&nbsp;&nbsp;g g.</em></p>

<p>The English madrigals found in Sidney and especially in Drummond
resemble the Italian madrigals only in subject; in their form they
differ widely from their models, as they consist of from fifteen to five
lines and have the structure of canzone-stanzas of three- and five-foot
verses. The stanzas run on an average from eight to twelve lines. As a
specimen the twelfth madrigal of Drummond (<cite>Poets,</cite> iv. 644), according
to the formula <em>a<sub>3</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub> d d<sub>5</sub></em>, may be quoted
here:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Trees happier far than I,</div>
    <div class="line">Which have the grace to heave your heads so high,</div>
    <div class="line">And overlook those plains:</div>
    <div class="line">Grow till your branches kiss that lofty sky,</div>
    <div class="line">Which her sweet self contains.</div>
    <div class="line">There make her know mine endless love and pains,</div>
    <div class="line">And how these tears which from mine eyes do fall,</div>
    <div class="line">Help you to rise so tall:</div>
    <div class="line">Tell her, as once I for her sake lov’d  breath,</div>
    <div class="line">So for her sake I now court lingering death.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Other madrigals have the following schemes (the first
occurring twice in Sidney and once in Drummond, while the
rest are found in Drummond only):</p>

<p>fifteen lines, <em>a<sub>3</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> d<sub>5</sub> d<sub>3</sub> e e<sub>5</sub> d<sub>3</sub> e f f<sub>5</sub></em>;
fourteen lines, <em>a a<sub>3</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c d<sub>5</sub> e e<sub>3</sub> d f<sub>5</sub> d<sub>3</sub> f<sub>5</sub></em>;
thirteen lines, <em>a a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c c<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub> d d<sub>5</sub> e<sub>3</sub> f e f<sub>5</sub></em>; twelve
lines,<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_381" id="Pg_381" title="381"></a><em>a<sub>2</sub> b<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> a<sub>5</sub> c d<sub>3</sub> d c<sub>5</sub> c e<sub>3</sub> f f<sub>5</sub></em>; eleven lines, <em>a<sub>3</sub>
b c a<sub>5</sub> b d<sub>3</sub> d e e f f<sub>5</sub></em>; ten lines, <em>a b<sub>3</sub> b a<sub>5</sub> a c b<sub>3</sub> c d d<sub>5</sub></em>;
nine lines, <em>a<sub>3</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b c b<sub>3</sub> c c d d<sub>5</sub></em>; eight lines, <em>a<sub>3</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b b c<sub>3</sub>
c d d<sub>5</sub></em>; seven lines, <em>a b a<sub>3</sub> c c<sub>5</sub> a<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub></em>; six lines, <em>a b b a c<sub>3</sub>
c<sub>5</sub></em>; five lines, <em>a b b<sub>3</sub> a b<sub>5</sub></em>. For specimens of these and other
madrigals in Drummond cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 508</p>

<p><a name="section317" id="section317"></a>
§ <b>317.</b> Some poems in Drummond’s and Sidney’s works entitled epigrams
consist, as a rule, of two or more five-foot verses, rhyming in
couplets. In Sidney there are also short poems resembling these in
subject, but consisting of one-rhymed Alexandrines. We have also one in
R. Browning (iii. 146) of seven one-rhymed Septenary verses; several
others occur in D. G. Rossetti (<ins class="correction" title="read: Poetical Works, London, 1891, pp. 330&ndash;;32">ii. 137&ndash;40</ins><a name="errata_8" id="errata_8"></a>) of eight lines on the
schemes <em>a a<sub>4</sub> b b<sub>4</sub> a a<sub>4</sub> b b<sub>4</sub></em> styled Chimes (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§
570, 571.)</p>

<p><a name="section318" id="section318"></a>
§ <b>318.</b> The <b>terza-rima</b>. Of much greater importance is another
Italian form, viz. a continuous stanza of eleven-syllable verses, the
terza-rima, the metre in which Dante wrote his Divina Commedia. It first
appears in English poetry in Chaucer’s Complaint to his Lady, second and
third part,<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> but may be said to have been introduced into English
literature by Wyatt, who wrote satires and penitential psalms in this
form (Ald. ed. pp. 186&ndash;7, 209&ndash;34), and by Surrey in his <cite>Description of
the restless state of a Lover</cite> (Ald. ed. p. 1). The rhyme-system of the
terza-rima is <em>a b a b c b c d c</em>, &amp;c. That is to say, the first and
third lines of the first triplet rhyme together, while the middle line
has a different rhyme which recurs in the first and third line of the
second triplet; and in the same manner the first and third lines of each
successive triplet rhyme with the middle line of the preceding one, so
as to form a continuous chain of three-line stanzas of iambic five-foot
verses till the end of the poem, which is formed by a single line added
to the last stanza and rhyming with its second line.</p>

<p>The first stanzas of Surrey’s poem may be quoted here:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">The sun hath twice brought forth his tender green,</div>
    <div class="line">Twice clad the earth in lively lustiness;</div>
    <div class="line">Once have the winds the trees despoiled clean,</div>
    <div class="line indent2">And once again begins their cruelness;</div>
    <div class="line">Since I have hid under my breast the harm</div>
    <div class="line">That never shall recover healthfulness.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_382" id="Pg_382" title="382"></a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line indent2">The winter’s hurt recovers with the warm;</div>
    <div class="line">The parched green restored is with shade;</div>
    <div class="line">What warmth, alas! may serve for to disarm</div>
    <div class="line indent2">The frozen heart, that mine in flame hath made?</div>
    <div class="line">What cold again is able to restore</div>
    <div class="line">My fresh green years, <span class="normal">&amp;c., &amp;c.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The terza-rima has not the compact structure of the sonnet,
as in each of its stanzas a rhyme is wanting which is only
supplied in the following stanza. For this reason it seems to
be especially adapted for epic or reflective poetry.</p>

<p>Comparatively few examples of this form are met with in
English poetry, as e.g. in Sidney, S. Daniel, Drummond,
Milton, and Shelley (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 572).</p>

<p>In Sidney and R. Browning (iii. 102) we also find a variety
of the terza-rima consisting of four-foot verses, and in Browning
some others formed of four-stressed verses (iv. 288).</p>

<p>Some similar rhyme-systems of three lines, occurring in
Sidney and Drummond, are of less importance (cf. ib., § 573)</p>

<p><a name="section319" id="section319"></a>
§ <b>319.</b> Certain other varieties of the terza-rima, although found in
recent poets, need only be briefly noticed here.</p>

<p>One of four lines on the model <em>a a b a<sub>5</sub> &nbsp; b b c b<sub>5</sub> &nbsp; c c d c<sub>5</sub></em>, &amp;c.,
occurs in Swinburne, <cite>Poems</cite>, ii. 32, 34, 239; another on the scheme <em>a
a b a<sub>5</sub>, c c b c<sub>5</sub>, d d e d<sub>5</sub></em>, &amp;c., ib. i. 13; a third one, following
the formula <em>a b c<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub>, a b c<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub>, a b c<sub>3</sub> b<sub>2</sub></em>, called <em>Triads</em>,
ib. ii. 159 (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 564).</p>

<p>Five-lined forms, similar to the terza-rima, occur in Sidney, e.g.
<em>abcdd, efghh, iklmm</em>, the rhymeless lines being connected by sectional
rhyme, the stanzas themselves likewise by sectional rhyme; another on
the model <em>a<sub>5</sub> b<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub> c<sub>3</sub> B<sub>5</sub>, B<sub>5</sub> d<sub>3</sub> e<sub>5</sub> e<sub>3</sub> D<sub>5</sub>, D<sub>5</sub> f<sub>3</sub> g<sub>5</sub> g<sub>3</sub> F<sub>5</sub></em>; and a third
on the scheme <em>a<sub>3</sub> a<sub>5</sub> b c<sub>3</sub> b<sub>5</sub>, c<sub>3</sub> c<sub>5</sub> d e<sub>3</sub> d<sub>5</sub>, e<sub>3</sub> e<sub>5</sub> f g<sub>3</sub> f<sub>5</sub></em>, &amp;c. A
related form, <em>a b a b c<sub>4</sub>, c d c d e<sub>4</sub>, ... y z y z z<sub>4</sub></em>, is found in Mrs.
Browning (iv. 44). For specimen cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 575.</p>

<p>A terza-rima system of six lines may be better mentioned in this section
than together with the sub-varieties of the sextain, as was done in
<cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §578; they pretty often occur in Sidney, e.g. <cite>Pansies</cite>,
ix (Grosart, i. 202), on the schemes <em>a b a b c b, c d c d e d, e f e f g f, v w v w x w,
... x y x y z y y</em>.</p>

<p>In Spenser’s <cite>Pastoral Aeglogue</cite> on Sidney (pp. 506&ndash;7) a rhyme-system
according to <em>a b c a b c<sub>5</sub>, d b e d f e<sub>5</sub>, g f h g i h<sub>5</sub>, k i l k m l<sub>5</sub></em>, &amp;c.
is met with; in Mrs. Browning (iii. 236) a much<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_383" id="Pg_383" title="383"></a> simpler system,
constructed of five-foot lines on the formula <em>a b a b a b c d c d c d e
f e f e f</em>, &amp;c., is used.</p>

<p>A system of ten lines, consisting of five-foot verses (<em>a b a b b c a e
d D, D e d e e f d f g G, G h g h h i g i k K</em>, &amp;c., ending in a stanza
of four lines, <em>X y x y</em>) occurs in Sidney, pp. 218&ndash;20 (221&ndash;4, xxxi);
cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 580</p>

<p><a name="section320" id="section320"></a>
§ <b>320.</b> Still less popular was another Italian poetical form, the
<b>sextain</b>, originally invented by the Provençal poet, Arnaut Daniel,
and for the first time reproduced in English poetry by Sidney in his
<cite>Arcadia</cite>.</p>

<p>The sextain consists of eleven-syllabled or rather five-foot verses
and has six stanzas of six lines each, and an envoy of three lines
in addition. Each of the six stanzas, considered individually, is
rhymeless, and so is the envoy. But the end-words of the lines of each
stanza from the second to the sixth are identical with those of the
lines in the preceding stanza, but in a different order, viz. six,
one, five, two, four, three. In the envoy, the six end-words of the
first stanza recur, in the same order, alternately in the middle and
at the end of the line. Hence the whole system of rhymes (or rather of
recurrence of end-words) is as follows: <em>a b c d e f . f a e b d c . c
f d a b e . e c b f a d . d e a c f b . b d f e c a + (a) b (c) d (e) f</em>.</p>

<p>The first two stanzas of Sidney’s <cite>Agelastus Sestine</cite>, pp. 438&ndash;9 (426&ndash;7,
lxxiv), together with the envoy and with the end-words of the other
stanzas, may serve to make this clear:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="line">Since wayling is a bud of causefull sorrow,</div>
      <div class="line">Since sorrow is the follower of evill fortune,</div>
      <div class="line">Since no evill fortune equals publike damage;</div>
      <div class="line">Now Prince’s losse hath made our damage publike</div>
      <div class="line">Sorrow, pay we to thee the rights of Nature,</div>
      <div class="line">And inward griefe seale up with outward wayling.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">

      <div class="line">Why should we spare our voice from endlesse wayling</div>
      <div class="line">Who iustly make our hearts the seate of sorrow,</div>
      <div class="line">In such a case, where it appears that Nature</div>
      <div class="line">Doth adde her force unto the sting of Fortune!</div>
      <div class="line">Choosing, alas, this our theatre publike,</div>
      <div class="line">Where they would leave trophees of cruell damage.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_384" id="Pg_384" title="384"></a></p>

<p>The other stanzas have the corresponding rhyme-words in this order:</p>

<div class="column-container">
  <div class="column">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;III<br />
    damage<br />
    wayling<br />
    publike<br />

    Nature
  </div><div class="column">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV<br />

  <div class="column">

    fortune<br />
    publike<br />
    wayling<br />
    nature<br />
    damage<br />
    sorrow
  </div>
</div>

<p>The envoy is:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Since sorrow, then, concludeth all our fortune,</div>
    <div class="line">With all our deaths shew we this damage publique:</div>
    <div class="line">His nature feares to dye, who lives still wayling.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This strict form of the sextain, which in Sidney, pp. 216&ndash;17 (219&ndash;21,
xxx), occurs even with a twofold rhyming system, but, of course, with
only one envoy, has, as far as we know, only once been imitated in
modern poetry, viz. by E. W. Gosse (<cite>New Poems</cite>). Cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §
576</p>

<p><a name="section321" id="section321"></a>
§ <b>321.</b> Besides this original form of the sextain several other
varieties are met with in English poetry. Thus Spenser, in the eighth
eclogue of his <cite>Shepherd’s Calendar</cite> (pp. 471&ndash;2), has a sextain of a
somewhat different structure, the rhymeless end-words being arranged in
this order: <em>a b c d e f. f a b c d e. e f a b c d. d e f a b c. c d e f
a b. b c d e f a + (a) b (c) d (e) f</em>. Here the final word of the last
verse of the first stanza, it is true, is also used as final word in the
first verse of the second stanza, but the order of the final words of
the other verses of the first stanza remains unchanged in the second.
The same relation of the end-words exists between st. ii to st. iii,
between st. iii to st. iv, &amp;c., and lastly between st. vi and the envoy;
the envoy, again, has the end-words of the first stanza; those which
have their place in the interior of the verse occur at the end of the
third measure.</p>

<p>Some other sub-varieties of the sextain have rhyming final words in each
stanza.</p>

<p>In Sidney’s <cite>Arcadia</cite>, p. 443 (430&ndash;1, lxxvi), e.g. one sextain has
the following end-words: <em>light</em>, <em>treasure</em>, <em>might</em>, <em>pleasure</em>,
<em>direction</em>, <em>affection</em>. These end-words recur in the following stanzas
in the order of the regular sextain; hence st. ii has <em>affection</em>,
<em>light</em>, <em>direction</em>, <em>treasure</em>, <em>pleasure</em>, <em>might</em>, &amp;c. In this
variety, also, the rhyme-words of the envoy occur at a fixed place, viz.
at the end of the second measure. Drummond wrote two sextains of the
same elegant form.</p>

<p>In Swinburne also (<cite>Poems</cite>, ii. 46) we have a sextain of rhymed stanzas,
the first stanza rhyming <em>day</em>, <em>night</em>, <em>way</em>, <em>light</em>,<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_385" id="Pg_385" title="385"></a><em>may</em>,
<em>delight</em>. All these recur in the following stanzas in a similar order,
though not so strictly observed as in the sextain by Spenser, mentioned
above (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 577).</p>

<p>One example (probably unique in English poetry) of what is known as the
<cite>Double Sextain</cite> is found in Swinburne’s <cite>The Complaint of Lisa</cite> (Poems,
ii. 60&ndash;8), a poem in which he has given one of the most brilliant
specimens of his skill in rhyming. It consists of twelve twelve-lined
stanzas and a six-lined envoy. The first two stanzas rhyme <em>a b c A B d
C e f E D F</em>, <em>F a f D A C b e c E d B</em>; the envoy on the scheme</p>

<p class="center"><em>(F) E (e) f (C) A (c) d (b) a (D) B</em>;</p>

<p>where the corresponding capital and small letters denote different
words rhyming with each other. Cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 581</p>

<p><a name="section322" id="section322"></a>
§ <b>322.</b> Side by side with these well-known poems of fixed
form, mostly constructed on Italian models, there are some
others influenced by French poetry which have been introduced
into English for the most part by contemporary modern poets,
as e.g. Swinburne, Austin Dobson, Robert Bridges, D.G.
Rossetti, A. Lang, and E.W. Gosse<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>. These are the virelay,
roundel, rondeau, triolet, villanelle, ballade, and chant royal.
The <b>virelay</b> seems to have been in vogue in earlier English
poetry. Chaucer, e.g. in his <cite>Legende of good Women</cite>, v. 423,
says of himself that he had written <em>balades</em>, <em>roundels</em>, and <em>virelayes</em>.
But only isolated specimens of it have been preserved;
in more recent times it has not been imitated at all.</p>

<p>According to Lubarsch<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> the virelay consists of verses of
unequal length, joined by <em>concatenatio</em> so as to form stanzas
of nine lines on the scheme: <em>a a b a a b a a b, b b c b b c b b c,
c c d c c d c c d, &amp;c.</em>

Apart from this, however, there were undoubtedly other
forms in existence (cf. Bartsch, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chrestomathie de l’ancien français</cite>,
p. 413). Morris, in the Aldine edition of Chaucer’s Works,
vol. vi, p. 305, gives a virelay of two-foot iambic verses in
six-lined stanzas on the model</p>

<p class="center"><em>a a a b a a a b, b b b c b b b c c c c d c c c d</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(quoted <cite>Metrik</cite>, i, § 155)</p>

<p><a name="section323" id="section323"></a>
§ <b>323.</b> The <b>roundel</b>, used by Eustache Deschamps, Charles d’Orléans,
and others, was introduced into English poetry, it seems, by Chaucer.
But there are only a few roundels of his in existence; one of these
occurs in <cite>The Assembly of Fowles<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_386" id="Pg_386" title="386"></a></cite> (ll. 681&ndash;8); if the verses of the
burden are repeated, as printed in the Globe Edition, pp. 638&ndash;9, it has
thirteen lines (<em><b>a b b</b> a b <b>a b</b> a b b <b>a b b</b></em>, the thick types
showing the refrain-verses):</p>

<p>Three other roundels of Chaucer on the scheme last mentioned
have been published lately by Skeat in <cite>Chaucer’s Minor
Poems</cite>, pp. 386&ndash;7; some other Middle English roundels were
written by Hoccleve and Lydgate.</p>

<p>In French the roundel was not always confined to one particular
metre, nor did it always consist of a fixed number of
verses; the same may be said of the English roundels.</p>

<p>The essential condition of this form, as used by the French
poets, was that two, three, or four verses forming a refrain
must recur three times at fixed positions in a tripartite isometrical
poem consisting mostly of thirteen or fourteen four- or
five-foot verses. A common form of the French roundel
consisted of fourteen octosyllabic verses on the model</p>

<p class="center"><em><b>a b</b> b a a b <b>a b</b> a b b a <b>a b</b></em>.</p>

<p>Conforming to this scheme is a roundel by Lydgate<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>:</p>

<p>Another roundel of four-foot verses, by Lydgate (Ritson, i. 129),
corresponds to <em><b>a b</b> a b a b <b>a b</b> a b a b <b>a b</b></em> (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, i, §
180); some other roundels, of a looser structure, consisting, seemingly,
of ten lines, are quoted in the same place (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 583).</p>

<p>A Modern English roundel of fourteen lines, constructed of three-foot
verses, by Austin Dobson, has the scheme <em><b>a b</b> a b b a <b>a b</b> a b a b
<b>a b</b></em> (quoted ib. § 583). The French roundel of thirteen lines may be
looked upon as a preliminary form to the rondeau, which was developed
from the roundel at the end of the fifteenth and the beginning of the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p><a name="section324" id="section324"></a>
§ <b>324.</b> The <b>rondeau</b> is a poem consisting of thirteen lines of eight
or ten syllables, or four or five measures. It has three stanzas of
five, three, and five lines, rhyming on the scheme <em>a a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;a
a b&nbsp;&nbsp;a a b b a</em>. It has, moreover, a refrain which is formed by
the first words of the first line, and recurs twice, viz. after the
eighth and thirteenth verses, with which it is syntactically connected.
Strictly speaking it therefore has fifteen lines, corresponding to the
scheme <em>a a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;a a b</em> + <em>r a a b b a</em> + <em>r</em>. The rondeau was
much cultivated by the French poet, Clément Marot. It was introduced
into English by Wyatt, from whom the rondeau <cite>Complaint for True Love
unrequited</cite> (p. 23) may be quoted here:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">What ’vaileth truth, or by it to take pain?</div>
    <div class="line">To strive by steadfastness for to attain</div>
    <div class="line">How to be just, and flee from doubleness?</div>
    <div class="line">Since all alike, where ruleth craftiness,</div>
    <div class="line">Rewarded is both crafty, false, and plain.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Pg_388" id="Pg_388" title="388"></a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="line">Soonest he speeds that most can lie and feign:</div>
      <div class="line">True meaning heart is had in high disdain,</div>
      <div class="line">Against deceit and cloaked doubleness,</div>
      <div class="line indent10">What ’vaileth truth?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="line">Deceived is he by false and crafty train,</div>
      <div class="line">That means no guile, and faithful doth remain</div>
      <div class="line">Within the trap, without help or redress:</div>
      <div class="line">But for to love, lo, such a stern mistress,</div>
      <div class="line">Where cruelty dwells, alas, it were in vain.</div>
      <div class="line indent10">What ’vaileth truth?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This is the proper form of the rondeau. Other forms deviating from it
are modelled on the schemes:</p>

<div class="lines-container">
  <div class="lines">
    <div class="line">a a b b a&nbsp;&nbsp;b b a <span class="normal">+</span> r&nbsp;&nbsp;b b a a b <span class="normal">+</span> r<span class="attrib">(Wyatt, p. 24),</span></div>

    <div class="line">a b b a a b <span class="normal">+</span> r&nbsp;&nbsp;a b b a <span class="normal">+</span> r <span class="attrib">(D. G. Rossetti, i. 179).</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Austin Dobson, Robert Bridges, and Theo. Marzials strictly follow the
form quoted above.</p>

<p>Another form of the rondeau entirely deviating from the above is found
in Swinburne, <cite>A Century of Roundels</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> where he combines verses of
the most varied length and rhythm on the scheme <em>A B A</em> + <em>b&nbsp;&nbsp;B A B&nbsp;&nbsp;A B A</em> +
<em>b</em> where <em>b</em> denotes part of a verse, rhyming with the second, but
repeated from the beginning of the first verse and consisting of one or
several words (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §§ 584, 585)</p>

<p><a name="section325" id="section325"></a>
§ <b>325.</b> The triolet and the villanelle are unusual forms occurring only
in modern poets, e.g. Dobson and Gosse.</p>

<p>The <b>triolet</b>, found as early as in Adenet-le-Roi at the beginning of
the thirteenth century, is a short poem of eight mostly octosyllabic
verses, rhyming according to the formula <em><b>a b</b> a <b>a</b> a b <b>a b</b></em>, the first
verse recurring as a refrain in the fourth, the first and second
together in the seventh and eighth place. Two specimens have been
quoted, <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 586</p>

<p><a name="section326" id="section326"></a>
§ <b>326.</b> The <b>villanelle</b> (a peasant song, rustic ditty, from
<em>villanus</em>) was cultivated by Jean Passerat (1534&ndash;1602); in modern
poetry by Th. de Banville, L. Baulmier, &amp;c. It mostly consists of
octosyllabic verses divided into five stanzas (sometimes a larger or
smaller number) of three lines plus a final stanza of four lines, the
whole corresponding to the scheme<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_389" id="Pg_389" title="389"></a> <em><b>a</b><sup>1</sup> b <b>a</b><sup>2</sup></em> + <em>a b <b>a</b><sup>1</sup></em> + <em>a b <b>a</b><sup>2</sup></em>
+ <em>a b <b>a</b><sup>1</sup></em> + <em>a b <b>a</b><sup>2</sup></em> + <em>a b <b>a</b><sup>1</sup> <b>a</b><sup>2</sup></em>. Hence the first and the third
verses of the first stanza are used alternately as a refrain to form the
last verse of the following stanzas, while in the last stanza both
verses are used in this way. A villanelle by Gosse on this model
consisting of eight stanzas, perhaps the only specimen in English
literature, has been quoted, <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 587</p>

<p><a name="section327" id="section327"></a>
§ <b>327.</b> The <b>ballade</b> is a poetical form consisting of somewhat longer
stanzas all having the same rhymes. Several varieties of it existed in
Old French poetry. The two most usual forms are that with octosyllabic
and that with decasyllabic lines. The first form is composed of three
stanzas of eight lines on the model <em>a b a b b c b C</em> (cf. § <a href="#section269">269</a>). The rhymes
in each stanza agree with those of the corresponding lines in the two
others, the last line, which is identical in all the three, forming the
refrain; this refrain-verse recurs also at the end of the <em>envoi</em>, which
corresponds in its structure to the second half of the main stanza,
according to the formula <em>b c b C</em>. The decasyllabic form has three stanzas
of ten verses on the scheme <em>a b a b b c c d c D</em> (cf. § <a href="#section271">271</a>), and an <em>envoi</em> of
five verses on the scheme <em>c c d c D</em>; the same rules holding good in all
other respects as in the eight-lined form. It is further to be observed
that the <em>envoi</em> began, as a rule, with one of the words <em>Prince</em>,
<em>Princesse</em>, <em>Reine</em>, <em>Roi</em>, <em>Sire</em>, either because the poem was
addressed to some personage of royal or princely rank, or because,
originally, this address referred to the poet who had been crowned as
‘king’ in the last poetical contest.</p>

<p>In England also the ballade had become known as early as in the
fourteenth century. We have a collection of ballades composed in the
French language by Gower,<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> consisting of stanzas of either eight or
seven (<em>rhyme royal</em>) decasyllabic verses with the same rhyme throughout
the poem. Similar to the French are Chaucer’s English ballades in his
Minor Poems, which, however, in so far differ from the regular form,
that the <em>envoi</em> consists of five, six, or seven lines; in some of the
poems even there is no <em>envoi</em> at all. Accurate reproductions of the Old
French ballade are not found again until recent times. There are
examples by Austin Dobson and especially by Swinburne <cite>(A Midsummer
Holiday</cite>, London, 1884). They occur in both forms, constructed as well
of four- and five-foot iambic, as of<a class="pagenum" name="Pg_390" id="Pg_390" title="390"></a> six-, seven-, or eight-foot
trochaic or of five- and seven-foot iambic-anapaestic verses. (For
specimens cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, § 588.)</p>

<p><a name="section328" id="section328"></a>
§ <b>328.</b> The <b>Chant Royal</b> is an extended ballade of five ten-lined
ballade-stanzas (of the second form mentioned above), instead of three,
together with an <em>envoi</em>. In Clément Marot we meet with another form of
five eleven-line stanzas of decasyllabic verses also with the same
rhymes throughout; the <em>envoi</em> having five lines. The scheme is
<em>a b a b c c d d e d E</em> in the stanzas and <em>d d e d E</em> in the <em>envoi</em>.</p>

<p>A Chant Royal by Gosse, composed on this difficult model (perhaps the
only specimen to be found in English poetry), is quoted <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii, §
589.</p>

<p>A more detailed discussion of these French poetical forms of a fixed
character and of others not imitated in English poetry may be found in
Kastner’s <cite>History of French Versification</cite> (Oxford, at the Clarendon
Press, 1903), chapter x. Cf. also Edmund Stengel, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Romanische

It should be remarked that in Sanskrit, as in the classical
       languages, that prominence of one of the syllables of a word,
       which is denoted by the term ‘accent’, was originally marked
       by pitch or elevation of tone, and that in the Teutonic
       languages the word-accent is one of stress or emphasis.</p>

This is not very common in poetry of the more regular metrical
       structure, but is found in Ælfric’s lines, in which we find
       hemistichs without any alliterating letter, and others where the
       alliteration is continued in the following line; two-thirds,
       however, of his lines are formed quite correctly.</p>

The occurrence of this licence in Chaucer’s heroic verse has
        been disputed by ten Brink (<cite>Chaucer’s Sprache und Verskunst</cite>,
        p. 176) and others, but see <cite>Metrik</cite>, i. 462&ndash;3, and
        Freudenberger, <i>Ueber das Fehlen des Auftaktes in Chaucer’s

We therefore hold ten Brink to be wrong in asserting
        (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Chaucer’s Sprache und Verskunst</cite>, § 307, 3. Anm.) that no
        redundant or hypermetrical syllable is permissible in the
        caesural pause of Chaucer’s iambic line of five accents,
        although he recognizes that in lines of four accents Chaucer
        admits the very same irregularity, which moreover has remained
        in use down to the present day. Cf. Skeat, <cite>Chaucer Canon</cite>,
        Oxford, 1900, pp. 31&ndash;3, and Schipper in Paul’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Grundriss</cite>,
        ed. 2, II. ii, pp, 217&ndash;18. On this point, as also on several
        others, Miss M. Bentinck Smith, the translator of ten Brink’s
        work, is of our opinion (cf. her Remarks on Chapter III of ten
        Brink’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Chaucer’s Sprache und Verskunst</cite> in <cite>The Modern
        Language Quarterly</cite>, vol. v, No. 1, April, 1902, pp. 13&ndash;19). A
        contrary view with regard to ‘extra syllables’ in the heroic
        and the blank-verse line (sixteenth and seventeenth centuries)
        is taken by A. P. van Dam and Cornelis Stoffel, <cite>Chapters on

In the reading of the Bible and Liturgy the older syllabic

The verses he calls five-foot lines have, on the other hand,
        decidedly not this structure, but are four-foot lines with
        unaccented rhymes; for a final word in the line, such us
        <em>wrécfúl</em>, as is assumed by Ten Brink, with the omission of an
        unaccented syllable between the last two accents, would be
        utterly inconsistent with the whole character of this metre.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_152" id="Footnote_152"></a><a href="#FNanchor_152"><span class="label">[152]</span></a>
According to Ten Brink, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Chaucer’s Sprache und Verskunst</cite>,
        § 305, the shifting character of Chaucer’s caesura was chiefly
        caused by his acquaintance with the Italian <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">endecasillabo</em>.
        This influence may have come in later, but even in Chaucer’s
        early <cite>Compleynt to Pitee</cite> (according to Ten Brink,
        <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geschichte der englischen Literatur</cite>, ii. p. 49, his first
        poem written under the influence of the French decasyllabic
        verse) the caesura is here moveable, though not to the same
        extent as in the later poems. The liability of the caesura to
        shift its position was certainly considerably increased by the
        accentual character of English rhythm. On the untenableness of
        his assertion, that in Chaucer’s five-accent verse the epic
        caesura is unknown, cf. p. 145 (footnote), <cite>Metrik</cite>, ii. 101&ndash;3
        note, and Schipper in Paul’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Grundriss</cite>, ed. 2, II. ii, pp.

The word stanza is explained by Skeat, <cite>Conc. Etym. Dict.</cite>, as follows:</p>

<p>‘STANZA. Ital. stanza, O.Ital. <em>stantia</em>, “a lodging, chamber,
        dwelling, also <em>stance</em> or staffe of verses;” Florio. So
        called from the stop or <em>pause</em> at the end of it.&mdash;Low Lat.
        <em>stantia</em>, an abode.&mdash;Lat. <em>stant-</em>, stem of pres. pt. of

So called from a poet Leo of the Middle Ages (c. 1150) who
        wrote in hexameters rhyming in the middle and at the end.
        Similar verses, however, had been used occasionally in classic
        Latin poetry, as e.g. <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quot caelum stellas, tot habet tua Roma
        puellas</em>, Ovid, Ars Amat. i. 59.</p>

This form of stanza is of great importance in the anisometrical
        ‘lays’, which cannot be discussed in this place (cf. <cite>Metrik</cite>,
        i, § 168). In these poems the strophic arrangement is not
        strictly followed throughout, but only in certain parts; a
        general conformity only is observed in these cases.</p>

It is worth noticing that there are also tripartite stanzas in
        Middle English, either allied to the bob-wheel stanza or
        belonging to it, both in lyric and dramatic poetry; e.g. the
        ten-lined stanza of a poem in Wright’s <cite>Songs and Carols</cite> (Percy
        Soc., 1847), p. 15, on the scheme <em>A B A B C C C<sub>4</sub> d<sub>1</sub> D D<sub>4</sub></em>
        (quoted in <cite>Metrik</cite>, i, p. 406); one of eleven lines according
        to the formula <em>A A A<sub>4</sub> B<sub>3</sub> C C C<sub>4</sub> B<sub>3</sub> d<sub>1</sub> B D<sub>3</sub></em> in the
        <cite>Towneley Mysteries</cite>, p. 224 (quoted in <cite>Metrik</cite>, i, p. 407),
        and one of thirteen lines, used in a dialogue, corresponding to
        the scheme <em>A B A B A A B A A B<sub>3</sub> c<sub>1</sub> B<sub>3</sub> C<sub>2</sub></em>, ibid., pp. 135&ndash;9
